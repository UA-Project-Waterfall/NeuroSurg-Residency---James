AB  - BACKGROUND: Mass lesions within the insular are diagnostically and surgically 
      challenging due to the numerous critical cortical, subcortical, and vascular 
      structures surrounding the region. Two main surgical techniques - the 
      transsylvian approach and the transcortical approach - provide access to the 
      insular cortex. Of the range of pathologies encountered, abscesses in the insula 
      are surprisingly rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old patient was admitted for 
      surgical resection of a suspected high-grade glioma in the insula of the dominant 
      hemisphere. A rapid clinical decline prompted emergent neurosurgical intervention 
      using a transsylvian approach. Surprisingly, abundant purulent material was 
      encountered on entering the insular fossa. Pathological analysis confirmed an 
      insular abscess, although a source of infection could not be identified. The 
      patient required a second evacuation for reaccumulation of the abscess and 
      adjuvant corticosteroids for extensive cerebral edema. CONCLUSION: An abscess 
      located in the insular cortex is an incredibly rare occurrence. Surgical 
      management using the transsylvian approach is one option to approach this region. 
      Familiarity with this approach is thus extremely beneficial in situations 
      requiring emergent access to the dominant insula when awake mapping is not 
      feasible. In addition, treatment of abscesses with adjuvant corticosteroids is 
      indicated when extensive, life-threatening cerebral edema is present.

      xanthoastrocytoma: illustrative case.
LID - CASE22310 [pii]
LID - 10.3171/CASE22310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence of neoplastic 
      tissue is known to occur in a number of high-grade gliomas. This fluorescence 
      helps surgeons maximize safe resection by distinguishing previously indiscernible 
      neoplastic tissue from brain parenchyma. Still, the effectiveness of 5-ALA has 
      not been fully explored for all central nervous system tumors. Consequently, the 
      full spectrum of tumors that would benefit from fluorescence-guided surgery using 
      5-ALA is unknown. OBSERVATIONS: This report describes successfully utilizing 
      5-ALA to achieve complete resection of a recurrent anaplastic pleomorphic 
      xanthoastrocytoma (APXA). LESSONS: APXA tumor cells accumulate sufficient amounts 
      of 5-ALA and its fluorescent metabolite to produce visible intraoperative 
      fluorescence. However, further investigation is needed to determine if 5-ALA 
      fluorescent labeling routinely occurs in patients with APXAs.

TI  - Optimizing Actigraphic Estimation of Sleep Duration in Suspected Idiopathic 
      Hypersomnia.
PG  - 597-602
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.7722 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the optimal Actiwatch 2 setting configuration for 
      the estimation of total sleep time (TST) in persons with suspected idiopathic 
      hypersomnia. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic 
      hypersomnia (28 female; mean age = 33.7 ± 10.5) underwent ad libitum 
      polysomnography with concurrent use of the Actiwatch 2. Actiwatch 2 sleep-wake 
      activity threshold (SWAT; Low, Medium, and High) and sleep immobility onset and 
      offset (SIOO; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 epoch) duration were modified during data 
      processing. The resultant 18 unique setting combinations were subsequently 
      evaluated using Bland-Altman and epoch comparison analyses to determine optimal 
      settings relative to polysomnography. RESULTS: Low SWAT + 25 Epoch SIOO displayed 
      the least divergence from polysomnography (mean difference 3.4 minutes). Higher 
      SWAT and lower SIOO increased sensitivity and accuracy, but at the expense of 
      reducing specificity and the ability to accurately estimate TST. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results demonstrate that actigraphic settings should be carefully 
      considered when estimating sleep duration. The Low + 25 Epoch configuration is 
      indicated as most optimal for estimating TST in persons with suspected idiopathic 
      hypersomnia. COMMENTARY: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on 
      page 539.

TI  - Spontaneous rupture of an arachnoid cyst in an adult: illustrative case.
LID - CASE22420 [pii]
LID - 10.3171/CASE22420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts are common intracranial mass lesions frequently 
      discovered as incidental findings on radiographic imaging. It is routine practice 
      to monitor these lesions as a large majority remain stable. Although traumatic 
      cyst rupture is a known risk, it is rare for patients to present with spontaneous 
      rupture. OBSERVATIONS: The authors report the case of a 32-year-old patient who 
      required emergent neurosurgical intervention for spontaneous rupture of a left 
      hemispheric arachnoid cyst. LESSONS: Patients with ruptured arachnoid cysts can 
      present with vague, nonspecific symptoms that may delay diagnosis. If not 
      diagnosed and treated promptly, arachnoid cyst rupture can progress to a 
      neurosurgical emergency as the subdural collection may cause extensive mass 
      effect and even cerebral herniation.

TI  - Economic Trends in Commonly Used Drugs for Spinal Fusion and Brain Tumor 
      Resection: An Analysis of the Medicare Part D Database.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11082185 [doi]
LID - 2185
AB  - With the incidence of central and peripheral nervous system disorders on the 
      rise, neurosurgical procedures paired with the careful administration of select 
      medications have become necessary to optimize patient outcomes. Despite efforts 
      to decrease the over-prescription of common addictive drugs, such as opioids, 
      prescription costs continue to rise. This study analyzed temporal trends in 
      medication use and cost for spinal fusion and brain tumor resection procedures. 
      The Medicare Part B Database was queried from 2016 to 2020 for data regarding 
      spinal fusion and brain tumor resection procedures, while the Part D Database was 
      used to extract data for two commonly prescribed medications for each procedure. 
      Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression were completed for the 
      analyzed variables. The results showed a significant negative correlation between 
      the number of spinal procedure beneficiaries and the cost of methocarbamol, as 
      well as between the annual percent change in spinal beneficiaries and the annual 
      percent change in oxycodone cost. Linear regression revealed that oxycodone cost 
      was the only parameter with a statistically significant model. Moving forward, it 
      is imperative to combat rising drug costs, regardless of trends seen in their 
      usage. Further studies should focus on the utilization of primary data in a 
      multi-center study.

AB  - Recent clinical trials have highlighted the limited efficacy of T cell-based 
      immunotherapy in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). To better understand the 
      characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in GBM, we performed 
      cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and 
      single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with paired V(D)J sequencing, 
      respectively, on TIL from two cohorts of patients totaling 15 patients with high 
      grade glioma, including GBM or astrocytoma, IDH mutant, grade 4 (G4A). Analysis 
      of the CD8+ TIL landscape reveals an enrichment of clonally expanded GZMK+ 
      effector T cells in the tumor compared to matched blood, which was validated at 
      the protein level. Furthermore, integration with other cancer types highlights 
      the lack of a canonically exhausted CD8+ T cell population in GBM TIL. These data 
      suggest that GZMK+ effector T cells represent an important T cell subset within 
      the GBM microenvironment and which may harbor potential therapeutic implications.

AB  - New neurons arise from quiescent adult neural progenitors throughout life in 
      specific regions of the mammalian brain. Little is known about the embryonic 
      origin and establishment of adult neural progenitors. Here, we show that Hopx(+) 
      precursors in the mouse dentate neuroepithelium at embryonic day 11.5 give rise 
      to proliferative Hopx(+) neural progenitors in the primitive dentate region, and 
      they, in turn, generate granule neurons, but not other neurons, throughout 
      development and then transition into Hopx(+) quiescent radial glial-like neural 
      progenitors during an early postnatal period. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses of 
      Hopx(+) embryonic, early postnatal, and adult dentate neural progenitors further 
      reveal common molecular and epigenetic signatures and developmental dynamics. 
      Together, our findings support a "continuous" model wherein a common neural 
      progenitor population exclusively contributes to dentate neurogenesis throughout 
      development and adulthood. Adult dentate neurogenesis may therefore represent a 
      lifelong extension of development that maintains heightened plasticity in the 
      mammalian hippocampus.

AB  - This section reviews the selection criteria and best practices for endoscopic 
      cerebrovascular surgery, focusing on purely endoscopic endonasal approaches. 
      Although these approaches still play a limited role in open vascular 
      neurosurgery, they offer a robust and potentially safer technique for 
      establishing visualization and vascular control of particular, well-selected 
      pathologies, such as aneurysms of the proximal circulation; this requires strong, 
      multidisciplinary experience with endoscopic anatomy and surgical technique, 
      advanced reconstruction techniques, and instruments designed to be maneuvered 
      within this relatively novel corridor and application.

AB  - Sinonasal glomangiopericytoma is a rare vascular tumor of the respiratory 
      epithelium. Treatment consists mainly of surgical resection, though there is no 
      consensus regarding the use of adjuvant therapies or preoperative endovascular 
      embolization. The postsurgical prognosis is favorable, though there is a high 
      risk of delayed recurrence. Here, we present the case of a patient who underwent 
      endoscopic resection of a sinonasal glomangiopericytoma and a review of the 
      literature.

TI  - Neuroophthalmological manifestations of congenital aqueductal stenosis.
PG  - 320-325
LID - 10.3171/2021.2.PEDS20824 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Congenital aqueductal stenosis (CAS) is a common etiology of 
      hydrocephalus that occurs in a subset of infants and may be linked to an 
      increased incidence of ophthalmological abnormalities and delayed developmental 
      milestones. Although hydrocephalus is common and widely studied, sparse 
      literature exists on patients with isolated (no identifiable genetic link) CAS 
      along with analysis of ophthalmological manifestations. In this study, the 
      authors sought to describe the ophthalmological abnormalities and delayed 
      developmental milestones of patients with isolated CAS. METHODS: Data of patients 
      with CAS were prospectively entered and monitored in a surgical database 
      maintained by the Department of Neurological Surgery at Children's Hospital of 
      Pittsburgh from January 2005 to October 2016. Patients with a family history of 
      congenital hydrocephalus, positive testing for genetic forms of aqueductal 
      stenosis, other congenital abnormalities suggesting an underlying genetic 
      syndrome, and stenosis/obstruction due to secondary causes were excluded from 
      this study. Prenatal and perinatal history, CSF diversion history, and a variety 
      of outcomes, including ophthalmological deficits and developmental milestones, 
      were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients with isolated CAS 
      were identified, with a mean follow-up duration of 6 years. Among that cohort, 26 
      patients (63.4%) developed neuroophthalmological complications, which were 
      further stratified. Fourteen patients (34.1%) developed strabismus and 11 (26.8%) 
      developed astigmatism, and 1 patient (2.4%) with papilledema was recorded. Among 
      patients with ophthalmological abnormalities, 76.9% had delayed developmental 
      milestones (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CAS were found to have 
      increased risk of ophthalmological abnormalities requiring correction, along with 
      an increased risk of delayed developmental milestones. Importantly, there was a 
      significant correlation between the development of ophthalmological abnormalities 
      and delayed developmental milestones that was independent of CSF diversion 
      history. Larger patient cohort studies are required to explore whether earlier 
      development of hydrocephalus, as is the case in CAS, causes elevated rates of 
      neurological and ophthalmological complications, and if earlier CSF diversion 
      correlates with improved outcomes.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.11.029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a global issue associated with 
      potentially debilitating long-term consequences, including chronic low back pain 
      (LBP). Short-term outcomes (<2 years) of patients with LDH have been extensively 
      studied and demonstrate improvements in back and leg pain for both operative and 
      conservative management. However, these improvements may not be sustained 
      long-term (>2 years); patients with LDH may develop recurrent disc herniations, 
      progressive degenerative disc disease, and LBP regardless of management strategy. 
      Therefore, our objective is to determine the prevalence of chronic LBP after LDH, 
      understand the relationship between LDH and chronic LBP, and investigate the 
      relationship between radiological findings and postoperative pain outcomes. 
      METHODS: We performed a literature review on the PubMed database via a 
      combination medical subject heading and keyword-based approach for long-term LBP 
      outcomes in patients with LDH. RESULTS: Fifteen studies (2019 patients) evaluated 
      surgical and/or nonoperative outcomes of patients with LDH . Regardless of 
      surgical or nonoperative management, 46.2% of patients with LDH experienced some 
      degree of LBP long-term (range 2-27 years) as compared to a point prevalence of 
      LBP in the general population of only 11.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LDH are 
      more likely to experience long-term LBP compared to the general population (46.2% 
      vs. 11.9%). Additionally, understanding the relationship between radiological 
      findings and pain outcomes remains a major challenge as the presence of 
      radiological changes and the degree of LBP do not always correlate. Therefore, 
      higher quality studies are needed to better understand the relationship between 
      radiological findings and pain outcomes.

AB  - Background  Intraoperative magnetic resonance images (iMRIs) have been variably 
      adopted by some centers to help increase the rate of gross total resection (GTR) 
      of pituitary adenomas. In this comparative study, we report our institution's 
      experience with using iMRIs for endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) pituitary 
      adenoma resection to better elucidate its role and potential value for pituitary 
      surgery. Methods  All adult patients who underwent EEA for a pituitary adenoma 
      from January 2013 to September 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. GTR was 
      defined as no residual tumor or recurrence on postoperative imaging within 6 
      months. Univariate analysis followed by multivariate analysis was performed with 
      GTR as the categorical endpoint. To measure the independent effect of iMRI on 
      GTR, propensity score matching was then performed. Results  A total of 351 
      pituitary adenoma patients who underwent EEA were identified. The mean age was 
      51.2 (range: 18-90) years and 196 (55.8%) patients were female. iMRI was utilized 
      in 87 (24.8%) cases. The overall rate of GTR was 69.2%. On multivariate analysis, 
      low Knosp grade, low tumor volume, and the use of iMRI were predictive of GTR. 
      There was no difference in the need for desmopressin or hydrocortisone at 90 days 
      postoperatively. Conclusion  At our institution, we report a significant absolute 
      increase in GTR rates of 16.4% for patients undergoing an iMRI. Among iMRI 
      patients who did not have GTR, the majority of residuals were intentionally left 
      behind after being deemed too risky to pursue. Overall, this study suggests the 
      high value that iMRI adds to endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery.

TI  - Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma with Failed Response to Induction 
      Chemotherapy.
PG  - e83-e86
LID - 10.1055/a-1871-3586 [doi]
AB  - Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rapidly growing malignancy with 
      a propensity for extensive local invasion. Multimodal therapy, including surgery, 
      radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, is the standard approach to treatment, but the 
      optimal sequence and combination of these modalities are uncertain. Induction 
      chemotherapy is being increasingly utilized based on recent reports that show 
      better outcomes for patients who respond to chemotherapy and the ability to 
      determine further course of treatment. We present a unique case of a patient with 
      locally advanced SNUC that did not respond to induction chemotherapy and a review 
      of the available literature relating to the management of this rare malignancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have questioned the safety and efficacy of minor 
      salivary gland biopsy in the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome, citing 
      complications and difficulty of pathologic evaluation. This study aims to 
      determine the rate of biopsy specimen adequacy and the risk of complications 
      after minor salivary gland biopsy. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Single 
      tertiary care center. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients who 
      underwent minor salivary gland biopsy at our institution from October 1, 2016, to 
      September 1, 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and serologic results 
      were recorded. The primary outcome was adequacy of the tissue sample. 
      Complications of the procedure were recorded. Biopsies with at least one focus of 
      ≥50 lymphocytes per 4-mm(2) sample were considered positive. RESULTS: We 
      identified 110 patients who underwent minor salivary gland biopsy. Ninety-three 
      (85%) were female, and the median age was 49.1 years (range, 18.7-80.5). 
      Seventy-seven procedures (70%) were performed in the office setting, and 33 (30%) 
      were performed in the operating room. Nearly all biopsy samples (n = 108, 98%) 
      were adequate, and 33 (31%) were interpreted as positive. Four patients (4%) 
      experienced temporary lip numbness, which resolved with conservative management. 
      No permanent complications were reported after lip biopsy. Nineteen (58%) 
      patients with positive biopsy results had no Sjögren's-specific antibodies. Most 
      patients with positive biopsy results (n = 20, 61%) subsequently started 
      immunomodulatory therapy. CONCLUSION: Minor salivary gland biopsy can be 
      performed safely and effectively in both the office and the operating room. This 
      procedure provides clinically meaningful information and can be reasonably 
      recommended in patients suspected to have Sjögren's syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to assess the quality and availability of 
      online information about fellowships accredited by the American Head & Neck 
      Society (AHNS). METHODS: AHNS directory pages and institutional web sites of 50 
      AHNS-accredited fellowships were identified. Web pages were scored using 20 
      standardized criteria including general information, application information, 
      alumni, surgical training, research, and quality-of-life. RESULTS: Median scores 
      for AHNS directory pages and institutional web sites were 11 (range: 7-14) and 10 
      (4-15), respectively. Faculty listings, contact information, program location, 
      number of positions, and breadth of surgical exposure were the most commonly 
      listed criteria. Less common criteria included didactic schedule, protected 
      academic time, previous research projects, year of accreditation, work-life 
      balance, fellow selection criteria, interview information, and salary. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The AHNS directory and institutional web sites are most 
      comprehensive in general program information and details about surgical training. 
      Information about the application process, work-life balance, and research 
      opportunities were less common.

TI  - Adoption of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk salivary gland malignancies.
PG  - 167-177
LID - 10.1002/hed.27222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study characterizes national trends in the utilization of 
      adjuvant chemotherapy to treat salivary gland malignancies. METHODS: The National 
      Cancer Database was queried for salivary gland malignancies treated by surgery 
      with radiation in 2004-2019. Proportions of patients receiving adjuvant 
      chemotherapy over the study period were analyzed by linear regression. The impact 
      of chemotherapy on overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox 
      proportional hazards analyses. RESULTS: Among 15 965 patients meeting inclusion 
      criteria, 2355 (14.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy utilization 
      significantly increased from 4.9% to 16.5% over the study period (p < 0.001). No 
      survival benefit was observed with adjuvant chemotherapy on propensity 
      score-matched Kaplan-Meier analysis (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.86-1.11; p = 0.72) or 
      multivariable Cox regression (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.78-1.09; p = 0.34). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy has been increasingly utilized to treat 
      salivary gland malignancies in recent years. Our findings highlight the 
      importance of obtaining high-quality prospective data regarding the benefit of 
      chemotherapy.

      disease-modifying therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity with disease modifying 
      therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains unclear, with some studies 
      demonstrating increased risks of infection with B-cell-depleting (anti-CD20) 
      therapies and severity, while others fail to observe an association. Most 
      existing studies are limited by a reliance on 'numerator' data (i.e., COVID-19 
      cases) only. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of COVID-19 by DMT, this study aimed 
      to assess both 'numerator' (patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection) and 'denominator' 
      data (all patients treated with DMTs of interest) to determine if any DMTs impart 
      an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease severity. METHODS: We 
      systematically reviewed charts and queried patients during clinic encounters in 
      the NYU MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCCC) for evidence of COVID-19 in all 
      patients who were on the most commonly used DMTs in our clinic 
      (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators (fingolimod/siponimod), 
      rituximab, ocrelizumab, fumarates (dimethyl fumarate/diroximel fumarate), and 
      natalizumab). COVID-19 status was determined by clinical symptoms (CDC case 
      definition) and laboratory testing where available (SARS-CoV-2 PCR, SARS-CoV-2 
      IgG). Multivariable analyses were conducted to determine predictors of infection 
      and severe disease (hospitalization or death) using SARS-CoV-2 infected 
      individuals per DMT group and all individuals on a given DMT as denominator. 
      RESULTS: We identified 1,439 MS patients on DMTs of interest, of which 230 had 
      lab-confirmed (n = 173; 75.2%) or suspected (n = 57; 24.8%) COVID-19. Infection 
      was most frequent in those on rituximab (35/138; 25.4%), followed by fumarates 
      (39/217; 18.0%), S1P modulators (43/250; 17.2%), natalizumab (36/245; 14.7%), and 
      ocrelizumab (77/589; 13.1%). There were 14 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. No DMT 
      was found to be significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Rituximab was a predictor of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection among 
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.1-41.7) but did not reach 
      statistical significance when the entire patient population on DMT was used (OR 
      2.8; 95% CI 0.6-12.2). No other DMT was associated with an increased risk of 
      severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of COVID-19 risk among all patients on the 
      commonly used DMTs did not demonstrate increased risk of infection with any DMT. 
      Rituximab was associated with increased risk for severe disease.

TI  - The role of endoscopic endonasal surgery in the management of prolactinomas based 
      on their invasiveness into the cavernous sinus.
PG  - 508-519
LID - 10.1007/s11102-022-01221-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To review our institutional experience with the surgical management of 
      prolactinomas through the endoscopic endonasal approach with specific focus on 
      cavernous sinus invasion. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were collected 
      retrospectively from the electronic medical record of 78 consecutive patients 
      with prolactinomas undergoing endoscopic endonasal resection from 2002 to 2019. 
      Immediate and late post-operative remission were defined as prolactin < 20 ng/mL 
      within 14 days and 1-year of surgery without adjuvant therapy, respectively. 
      Cavernous sinus invasion was quantified by Knosp score. RESULTS: A total of 78 
      patients with prolactinoma, 59% being male, underwent surgical resection with a 
      mean age of 37 ± 13 years. Indications for surgery were medication resistance in 
      38 patients (48.7%), medication intolerance in 11 (14.1%), and patient preference 
      in 29 (37.2%). Patients with Knosp 0-2 achieved higher immediate remission rates 
      (83.8%) compared to patients with Knosp 3 (58.8%) and Knosp 4 (41.7%) patients 
      (p = 0.003). Long-term remission rates were 48.7% and increased to 71.8% when 
      combined with adjuvant treatments. Knosp 4 prolactinomas had significantly higher 
      tumor volumes, higher preoperative prolactin levels, higher recurrence rates, 
      higher rates of adjuvant therapy utilization, and were more likely to have failed 
      dopamine agonist therapy compared to other tumor grades (p < 0.05). We 
      encountered 18 complications in our series, and no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. 
      CONCLUSION: The endoscopic endonasal approach is a safe and effective modality 
      that can be employed in properly selected patients with invasive prolactinomas. 
      It is associated with improved control and remission rates despite cavernous 
      sinus invasion, though at a lower rate than without invasion.

TI  - Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea from a Prolactin-Secreting Pituitary 
      Macroadenoma.
PG  - e13111

LID - e13111
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a rare complication of macroprolactinomas 
      that, in the vast majority of cases, is subsequent to either medical or surgical 
      intervention. Here, we present the successful management of a rare case of 
      spontaneous, noniatrogenic CSF rhinorrhea in a patient with an untreated 
      macroprolactinoma. A 27-year-old man with no significant medical history 
      presented with six months of persistent CSF rhinorrhea, which was confirmed by 
      testing for beta-2-transferrin. He had had decreased libido since adolescence and 
      impaired growth of secondary sexual characteristics. Workup revealed an elevated 
      prolactin level, and imaging demonstrated erosion of the anterior sellar floor 
      and soft tissue within the sphenoid sinus, concerning for tumor. The patient 
      underwent surgical repair of the CSF leak via a transnasal transsphenoidal 
      approach, with resection and biopsy of tumor material within the sinus. No tumor 
      was noted within the sella itself. The patient tolerated the procedure well and 
      had subsequent normalization of his prolactin level with no further CSF egress. 
      Spontaneous noniatrogenic CSF rhinorrhea, although rare, should be considered in 
      the differential diagnosis of invasive pituitary macroadenomas, especially 
      prolactinomas. The mechanism of CSF leak from a prolactinoma is not completely 
      understood, but the CSF leak should be urgently repaired through a transnasal 
      transsphenoidal approach. Concurrently, tumor resection should be performed and a 
      postoperative lumbar puncture or lumbar drain should be considered to reinforce 
      the skull base reconstruction.

LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1769893 [doi]
AB  - The de novo development of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in adults 
      is an exceedingly rare event that has prompted the theory that a "second hit" is 
      required to induce AVM formation. The authors document development of an 
      occipital AVM in an adult a decade and a half after a brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) disclosed no abnormality. A 31-year-old male with a family history 
      of AVMs and a 14-year history of migraines with visual auras and seizures 
      presented to our service. Because of the onset of a first seizure and migraine 
      headaches at age 17, the patient underwent high-resolution MRI that showed no 
      intracranial lesion. After 14 years of progressively worsening symptoms, he 
      underwent a repeat MRI that demonstrated a new de novo Spetzler-Martin grade 3 
      left occipital AVM. The patient received anticonvulsants and underwent Gamma 
      Knife radiosurgery for his AVM. This case suggests that patients with seizures or 
      persistent migraine headaches should have periodic repeat neuroimaging to exclude 
      the development of a vascular cause despite an initial negative MRI.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for hydrocephalus via ventriculoperitoneal 
      (VP) shunting is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. 
      Unfortunately, VP shunting also carries a high complication rate. While long-term 
      complications of VP shunting are generally well-described, the literature on more 
      acute, iatrogenic injury during shunt placement is essentially limited to easily 
      identifiable intracranial bleeds. Herein is presented the first reported case of 
      iatrogenic abdominal wall vessel injury as a consequence of blind distal VP shunt 
      catheter placement causing a critical haemoperitoneum that necessitated multiple 
      transfusions. Presentation and recognition of this bleed was delayed as it 
      occurred over a number of days. Injury to the inferior epigastric artery, or 
      potentially a distal branch of the superficial epigastric artery, is suspected to 
      have occurred during either blind subcutaneous tunnelling of the shunt catheter 
      passage or during penetration of the peritoneum. Haemoperitoneum as a potential 
      complication of procedures involving manipulation or penetration of the abdominal 
      wall (i.e. paracentesis) is well-described in the medical and general surgical 
      literature, and ultrasound-guidance has been widely adopted to mitigate bleeding 
      in these cases. Familiarity with intra-abdominal haemorrhage as a potential 
      complication of VP shunting and an understanding of its presentation is critical 
      for timely identification of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the use of real-time 
      ultrasound-guidance for tunnelling and distal shunt catheter placement may 
      decrease the incidence of intrabdominal complications after shunt placement more 
      generally and should be considered an area of future study.

TI  - Intraparenchymal hematoma and intraventricular catheter placement using robotic 
      stereotactic assistance (ROSA): A single center preliminary experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large supratentorial intraparenchymal hemorrhages are managed 
      emergently with image-guided catheters that aim to minimize injury to surrounding 
      parenchyma. Robotic assistance may offer advantages for stereotactic guidance and 
      placement of such catheters. We describe our center's experience with minimally 
      invasive ROSA-assisted intraventricular and intraparenchymal hemorrhage catheter 
      placement and delineate its safety and outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective 
      analysis was performed including all patients with intraparenchymal hematoma that 
      underwent ROSA-assisted intraparenchymal and intraventricular catheter placement 
      at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between 2017 and 2019. All 
      patients received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) through the intraparenchymal 
      catheter. We performed a manual chart review of these patients. Pertinent 
      clinical and radiological characteristics and patient outcomes were recorded and 
      analyzed. Catheter trajectory was independently quantified and analyzed by two 
      independent reviewers. Error between the planned trajectory and final position 
      was calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: Four patients (2 males and 2 females, mean 
      age of 64 years) with deep brain large volume intraparenchymal hemorrhages were 
      treated with catheter evacuation with robotic assistance. For 2 of the 4 
      patients, thin-cut CT imaging allowed for the real trajectory of the catheter to 
      be compared to the targeted trajectory to calculate error. The mean error of 
      catheter placement was 3.48 mm. ROSA-assisted catheter placement achieved up to 
      95% reduction of intraparenchymal hematoma volume with a statistically 
      significant decrease following catheter drainage (pre- 51.8 ± 19.1 cc vs. post- 
      13.0 ± 14.4; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Robotic stereotactic assistance offers a safe 
      and sufficiently accurate technique for intraparenchymal hematoma and 
      intraventricular catheter placement.

TI  - Comparing Rates of Postoperative Meningitis After Endoscopic Endonasal Procedures 
      Based on Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Methicillin-Sensitive 
      Staphylococcus aureus Colonization and Antibiotic Prophylaxis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) procedures are inherently 
      contaminated due to direct access through the nasopharyngeal mucosa. The reported 
      rate of postoperative meningitis in EEA procedures is 0.7%-3%. A variety of 
      methods exist to minimize the risk of meningitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, 
      although their value is not completely understood. This study investigated 
      whether there is a difference in rates of postoperative meningitis based on 
      Staphylococcus aureus colonization and use of preoperative antibiotic 
      prophylaxis. METHODS: All adult patients who underwent EEA resection at our 
      institution from 2013 to 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with 
      preoperative cerebrospinal fluid infections were excluded. Data including recent 
      preoperative infections, preoperative colonization status, antibiotic 
      administration, and postoperative outcomes were recorded for each patient. 
      RESULTS: Of 483 patients identified (mean age, 51 years; range, 18-90 years; 274 
      [56.7%] female), 80 (16.6%) had a positive preoperative methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)/methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 
      screening swab. Twenty-one (26.3%) colonized patients were treated with 
      preoperative decolonizing antibiotics. Within 30 days of surgery, 13 (2.7%) 
      patients developed culture-positive meningitis. There was no significant 
      difference in meningitis rates based on MRSA/MSSA colonization status. Among 
      colonized patients, there was no significant difference in rates of MRSA/MSSA 
      meningitis based on preoperative antibiotic decolonization. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Postoperative rates of meningitis after EEA surgery were not significantly 
      changed based on MRSA/MSSA colonization status of the patient or preoperative 
      decolonization. The utility of preoperative testing of MRSA/MSSA status and 
      antibiotics for decolonization to prevent postoperative meningitis should be 
      further investigated.

PG  - 1088-1093
LID - 10.1080/02688697.2022.2034745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterotactic radiosurgery is becoming an integral modality in the 
      management of intracranial meningiomas, both as the primary treatment or as 
      adjuvant therapy. This study analyzes the scholarly impact of the top 100 cited 
      articles on the stereotactic radiosurgical management of intracranial 
      meningiomas. METHODS: A ranked list of the 100 most-cited articles was generated 
      using the Scopus database by searching the keywords 'intracranial meningioma' and 
      'stereotactic radiosurgery'. All articles were then evaluated on multiple 
      criteria regarding both the publication of the articles (year of publication, 
      journal, country of origin, and authors) as well as their methods and foci (type 
      of study, location of studied meningiomas, and type of radiosurgical modality). 
      Quantitaitve and qualitative analyses were then performed from the collected 
      data. RESULTS: The most frequently cited articles on stereotactic radiosurgical 
      management of intracranial meningiomas were published between 1990 and 2016. The 
      average citation-per-year across all papers in the list was 6.1. The most studied 
      anatomic area of intracranial meningiomas was the skull base, with the cavernous 
      sinus being the most well-studied specific site. The most utilized stereotactic 
      radiosurgical modality was Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The country with the highest 
      number of publications was the United States. Twenty-six percent of the articles 
      were published in the journal Neurosurgery; Lunsford, Kondziolka, Flickinger, 
      Sheehan, and Pollock were respectively the most frequent listed authors among 
      this list. The most active academic institute publishing on this topic was the 
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery is 
      an integral modality in the management of intracranial meningiomas. This 
      bibliometric analysis sheds the light on the ways in which intracranial 
      meningiomas have been studied in the past two decades in order to identify trends 
      among neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists and to reveal areas of rising and 
      declining focus.

AB  - Background  Stereotactic radiosurgical rhizolysis of the trigeminal nerve is an 
      established modality increasingly employed to alleviate the symptoms of 
      refractory trigeminal neuralgia. This study analyzes the academic impact of the 
      top 100 cited articles on the radiosurgical management of trigeminal neuralgia. 
      Methods  The Scopus database was searched for articles containing "radiosurgery" 
      and one or more of "trigeminal neuralgia," "trigeminus neuralgia," and "tic 
      douloureux." The top 100 articles written in English were arranged in descending 
      order by citation count. Documents were evaluated for authors, publication year, 
      journal and impact factor, total citations, nationality, study type, 
      radiosurgical modality, and the affiliated institution. Quantitative and 
      qualitative analyses were performed on the data. Results  The most cited articles 
      were published between 1971 and 2019. The average citation per year was 4.3. The 
      most targeted anatomic area was the "root entry zone" or proximal portion of the 
      cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve. The most utilized modality was Gamma 
      Knife radiosurgery. The country with the highest number of publications was the 
      United States. Thirty-six percent of the articles were published in the Journal 
      of Neurosurgery . Lunsford, Kondziolka, Flickinger, and Régis, respectively, were 
      the most frequently listed co-authors. The most prolific institute was the 
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Conclusion  Stereotactic radiosurgery is 
      an important modality in the management of medically or surgically refractory 
      trigeminal neuralgia. This analysis assesses its contributions over the past five 
      decades to identify trends in treatment practices for neurosurgeons and to 
      highlight areas where further study is needed.

TI  - Chronic Encapsulated Expanding Hematomas After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for 
      Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations: An International Multicenter Case 
      Series.
PG  - 195-204
LID - 10.1227/neu.0000000000002175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a minimally invasive treatment 
      modality for appropriately selected intracranial arteriovenous malformations 
      (AVMs). Recent reports have described the development of rare, delayed chronic 
      encapsulated expanding hematomas (CEEHs) at the site of an angiographically 
      confirmed obliterated AVM. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the incidence, 
      characteristics, and management of CEEH in patients with AVM after SRS. METHODS: 
      The records of all patients who underwent SRS for an intracranial AVM at 4 
      institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation 
      between 1987 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Data regarding 
      characteristics of the AVM, SRS treatment parameters, CEEH presentation, 
      management, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 5430 
      patients, 15 developed a CEEH at a crude incidence of 0.28%. Nine patients were 
      female, and the mean age was 43 ± 14.6 years. Nine patients underwent surgical 
      evacuation, while 6 were managed conservatively. The median CEEH development 
      latency was 106 months after SRS. The patients were followed for a median of 32 
      months, and 9 patients improved clinically, while 6 patients remained stable. No 
      intraoperative complications were reported after CEEH resection, although 1 
      patient recovered from postoperative meningitis requiring intravenous 
      antibiotics. CONCLUSION: CEEH is a rare, late complication of AVM SRS with an 
      incidence of 0.28% and a median latency of 106 months. In the presence of a 
      delayed and symptomatic expanding hematoma in the bed of an angiographically 
      obliterated AVM, surgical resection resulted in clinical improvement in most 
      patients. Conservative management is possible in asymptomatic patients with 
      stable, small-sized hematomas in deeply seated locations.

TI  - United States Neurosurgery Department Program Directors: A Cross-Sectional 
      Evaluation of Current and Future Trends and Attributes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While United States (U.S.) neurosurgery residency programs have been 
      subject to many studies, none have focused solely on the program directors (PDs). 
      We aim to analyze the demographic, educational, and academic attributes of this 
      cohort to understand current and future trends of PDs. METHODS: One hundred 
      sixteen neurosurgeons listed as PDs at U.S. accredited neurosurgical residency 
      training programs as of August 2022 were assessed. Descriptive data including age 
      upon acceptance of role, gender, and h-index were collected from publicly 
      available sources. RESULTS: Most PDs matriculated to their positions before the 
      age of 45 years, were male, and had been hired internally. Approximately 25% of 
      PDs had earned an additional degree. Departments with higher aggregate h-indexes 
      were more likely to hire PDs with higher average publications per year (P < 
      0.001) and have a higher h-index (P < 0.001). PD subspecialty influenced h-index 
      (P < 0.05) and total average publications per year (P < 0.05) with neuro-oncology 
      subspecialists having higher averages in both. More recently hired PDs had a 
      higher average number of publications per year (P < 0.05) and were more likely to 
      hold an additional degree (odds ratio 1.14, P < 0.05). Female PDs were hired at a 
      younger age (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery PDs typically rise to their 
      position after 10 years of practice and more recent PD hires are more likely to 
      have additional degrees and more publications. As academic neurosurgery becomes 
      more competitive, increased academic productivity and acquisition of additional 
      degrees will become increasingly necessary.

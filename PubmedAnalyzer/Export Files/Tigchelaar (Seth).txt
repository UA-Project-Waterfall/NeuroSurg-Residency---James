TI  - Trochanteric osteotomy for acetabular fracture fixation: a case series and 
      literature review.
PG  - 161-165
LID - 10.1007/s00590-020-02753-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined osteotomy union and heterotopic ossification (HO) 
      after performing digastric trochanteric osteotomies during open reduction and 
      internal fixation (ORIF) of acetabular and combined femoral head fractures. 
      Femoral head osteonecrosis and trochanteric screw removal were secondarily 
      assessed. METHODS: Twenty-six patients treated at a Level I trauma center, from 
      years 2003 to 2019, who received a digastric trochanteric osteotomy during 
      acetabular and combined femoral head fracture ORIF through a posterior surgical 
      approach were retrospectively identified. Osteotomies were fixed with two 3.5 mm 
      cortical lag screws. Rates of osteotomy union, HO, femoral head osteonecrosis, 
      and trochanteric screw removal were determined. RESULTS: All osteotomies went 
      onto union without displacement or failure of fixation. Only three (12%) patients 
      developed severe HO (modified-Brooker class III-IV). There were no instances of 
      femoral head osteonecrosis and only one (7%) patient required trochanteric screw 
      removal. CONCLUSIONS: The digastric trochanteric osteotomy heals reliably with 
      low rates of severe HO, femoral head osteonecrosis, and screw removal for 
      soft-tissue irritation. A review of the literature is presented and found 
      comparable findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary tumors involving the spine are relatively rare but represent 
      surgically challenging procedures with high patient morbidity. En bloc resection 
      of these tumors necessitates large exposures, wide tumor margins, and poses risks 
      to functionally relevant anatomical structures. Augmented reality neuronavigation 
      (ARNV) represents a paradigm shift in neuronavigation, allowing on-demand 
      visualization of 3D navigation data in real-time directly in line with the 
      operative field. METHODS: Here, we describe the first application of ARNV to 
      perform distal sacrococcygectomies for the en bloc removal of sacral and 
      retrorectal lesions involving the coccyx in 2 patients, as well as a thoracic 
      9-11 laminectomy with costotransversectomy for en bloc removal of a schwannoma in 
      a third patient. RESULTS: In our experience, ARNV allowed our teams to minimize 
      the length of the incision, reduce the extent of bony resection, and enhanced 
      visualization of critical adjacent anatomy. All tumors were resected en bloc, and 
      the patients recovered well postoperatively, with no known complications. 
      Pathologic analysis confirmed the en bloc removal of these lesions with negative 
      margins. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ARNV is an effective strategy for the 
      precise, en bloc removal of spinal lesions including both sacrococcygeal tumors 
      involving the retrorectal space and thoracic schwannomas.

TI  - Outcomes of Biosynthetic and Synthetic Mesh in Ventral Hernia Repair.
PG  - e4707
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004707 [doi]
LID - e4707
AB  - The introduction of mesh for reinforcement of ventral hernia repair (VHR) led to 
      a significant reduction in hernia recurrence rates. However, it remains 
      controversial whether synthetic or biologic mesh leads to superior outcomes. 
      Recently, hybrid mesh consisting of reinforced biosynthetic ovine rumen (RBOR) 
      has been developed and aims to combine the advantages of biologic and synthetic 
      mesh; however, outcomes after VHR with RBOR have not yet been compared with the 
      standard of care. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on 109 patients, 
      who underwent VHR with RBOR (n = 50) or synthetic polypropylene mesh (n = 59). 
      Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, postoperative complications, and 
      recurrence rates were analyzed and compared between the groups. Multivariate 
      logistic regression models were fit to assess associations of mesh type with 
      overall complications and surgical site occurrence (SSO). RESULTS: Patients who 
      underwent VHR with RBOR were older (mean age 63.7 versus 58.8 years, P = 0.02) 
      and had a higher rate of renal disease (28.0 versus 10.2%, P = 0.01) compared 
      with patients with synthetic mesh. Despite an unfavorable risk profile, patients 
      with RBOR had lower rates of SSO (16.0 versus 30.5%, P = 0.12) and similar hernia 
      recurrence rates (4.0 versus 6.78%, P = 0.68) compared with patients with 
      synthetic mesh. The use of synthetic mesh was significantly associated with 
      higher odds for overall complications (3.78, P < 0.05) and SSO (3.87, P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Compared with synthetic polypropylene mesh, the use of RBOR for VHR 
      mitigates SSO while maintaining low hernia recurrence rates at 30-month 
      follow-up.

AB  - Despite the emergence of promising therapeutic approaches in preclinical studies, 
      the failure of large-scale clinical trials leaves clinicians without effective 
      treatments for acute spinal cord injury (SCI). These trials are hindered by their 
      reliance on detailed neurological examinations to establish outcomes, which 
      inflate the time and resources required for completion. Moreover, therapeutic 
      development takes place in animal models whose relevance to human injury remains 
      unclear. Here, we address these challenges through targeted proteomic analyses of 
      cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from 111 patients with acute SCI and, in 
      parallel, a large animal (porcine) model of SCI. We develop protein biomarkers of 
      injury severity and recovery, including a prognostic model of neurological 
      improvement at 6 months with an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve of 0.91, and validate these in an independent cohort. Through cross-species 
      proteomic analyses, we dissect evolutionarily conserved and divergent aspects of 
      the SCI response and establish the cerebrospinal fluid abundance of glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein as a biochemical outcome measure in both humans and 
      pigs. Our work opens up new avenues to catalyze translation by facilitating the 
      evaluation of novel SCI therapies, while also providing a resource from which to 
      direct future preclinical efforts.

TI  - Interaction of preoperative chemoprophylaxis and tranexamic acid use does not 
      affect transfusion in acetabular fracture surgery.
PG  - 1025-1029
LID - 10.1007/s00590-023-03763-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: While the effects of tranexamic acid (TXA) use on transfusion rates 
      after acetabular fracture surgery are unclear, previous evidence suggests that 
      holding deep vein thrombosis (DVT) chemoprophylaxis may improve TXA efficacy. 
      This study examines whether holding DVT chemoprophylaxis in patients receiving 
      TXA affects intraoperative and postoperative transfusion rates in acetabular 
      fracture surgery. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records (EMR) of 305 
      patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular 
      fractures (AO/OTA 62) and stratified patients per the following perioperative 
      treatment: (1) no intraoperative TXA (noTXA), (2) intraoperative TXA and no 
      preoperative DVT prophylaxis (opTXA/noDVTP), or (3) intraoperative TXA and 
      preoperative DVT prophylaxis (opTXA/opDVTP). The primary outcomes were need for 
      intraoperative or postoperative transfusion. Risk factors for each primary 
      outcome were assessed using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Intraoperative or 
      postoperative transfusion rates did not significantly differ between opTXA/opDVTP 
      and opTXA/noDVTP groups (46.2% vs. 36%, p = 0.463; 15.4% vs. 28%, p = 0.181). 
      Median units transfused did not differ between groups (2 ± 1 vs. 2 ± 1, 
      p = 0.515; 2 ± 1 vs. 2 ± 0, p = 0.099). There was no association between 
      preoperative DVT chemoprophylaxis and TXA with intraoperative or postoperative 
      transfusions. EBL, preoperative hematocrit, and IV fluids were associated with 
      intraoperative transfusions; age and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were 
      associated with postoperative transfusions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      holding DVT prophylaxis did not alter the effect of TXA on blood loss or need for 
      transfusion.

TI  - Medial Column Support in Pilon Fractures Using Percutaneous Intramedullary Large 
      Fragment Fixation.
PG  - e502-e506
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000002073 [doi]
AB  - Pilon fractures are complex injuries to the tibial plafond requiring stable 
      fixation in the setting of effective soft tissue management, particularly in 
      high-energy injuries, open fractures, or in geriatric individuals. Medial column 
      support of the distal tibial metaphysis is often an essential component when 
      applying balanced fixation. However, the biologic implications of multiple 
      surgical approaches in the setting of damaged tissue, devitalized bone, or 
      significant bone loss may contribute to increased complications. Percutaneous 
      intramedullary large fragment screws offer both stability and a soft 
      tissue-friendly approach for stabilizing the medial column. Here, we present our 
      technique and indications for medial column support in pilon fractures using 
      percutaneous large fragment fixation, along with our early clinical experience in 
      a case series of 7 patients. At minimum 6-month follow-up, all patients healed 
      their injuries with maintained alignment and without complications or further 
      reoperation. Medial column support with percutaneous large fragment fixation in 
      pilon fractures is a viable option to provide mechanical stability while 
      effectively managing tenuous soft tissue envelopes.

TI  - Advanced Age Does Not Impact Outcomes After 1-level or 2-level Lateral Lumbar 
      Interbody Fusion.
PG  - E368-E373
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0000000000001270 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective comparative study. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to assess the effect of increased age on 
      perioperative and postoperative complication rates, reoperation rates, and 
      patient-reported pain and disability scores after lateral lumbar interbody fusion 
      (LLIF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LLIF was developed to minimize soft tissue 
      trauma and reduce the risk of vascular injury; however, there is little evidence 
      regarding the effect of advanced age on outcomes of LLIF. METHODS: Patients who 
      underwent LLIF from 2009 to 2019 at one institution with a minimum 6-month 
      follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 18 years old with 
      musculoskeletal tumor or trauma were excluded. The primary outcome was the 
      preoperative to postoperative change in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for 
      back pain. Operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, perioperative 
      and 90-day complications, unplanned readmissions, reoperations, and change in 
      Oswestry Disability Index were also evaluated. Relationships with age were 
      assessed both with age as a continuous variable and segmenting by age below 70 
      versus 70+. RESULTS: In total, 279 patients were included. The median age was 
      65±13 years and 159 (57%) were female. Age was not related to improvements in 
      back NPRS and Oswestry Disability Index. Operative time, estimated blood loss, 
      length of stay, perioperative and 90-day complications, unplanned readmissions, 
      reoperations, and radiographic fusion rate also were not related to age. After 
      multivariable risk adjustment, increasing age was associated with greater 
      improvements in back NPRS. The decrease in back NPRS was 0.68 (95% confidence 
      interval: 0.14, 1.22; P=0.014) points greater for every 10-year increase in age. 
      Age was not associated with rates of complication, readmission, or reoperation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LLIF is a safe and effective procedure in the elderly population. 
      Advanced age is associated with larger improvements in preoperative back pain. 
      Surgeons should consider the benefits of LLIF and other minimally invasive 
      techniques when evaluating elderly candidates for lumbar fusion. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Level III.

TI  - Metastatic Pattern of Truncal and Extremity Leiomyosarcoma: Retrospective 
      Analysis of Predictors, Outcomes, and Detection.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12030345 [doi]
LID - 345
AB  - Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are a heterogenous group of malignant mesenchymal neoplasms 
      with smooth muscle origin and are classified as either non-uterine (NULMS) or 
      uterine (ULMS). Metastatic pattern, prognostic factors, and ideal 
      staging/surveillance studies for truncal and extremity LMS have not been defined. 
      A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with histopathology-confirmed 
      truncal or extremity LMS between 2009 and 2019 was conducted. Data collected 
      included demographics, tumor characteristics, staging, surveillance, and survival 
      endpoints. The primary site was defined as: (1) extremity, (2) flank/Pelvis, or 
      (3) chest wall/Spine. We identified 73 patients, 23.3% of which had metastatic 
      LMS at primary diagnosis, while 68.5% developed metastatic disease at any point. 
      The mean metastatic-free survival from primary diagnosis of localized LMS was 3.0 
      ± 2.8 years. Analysis of prognostic factors revealed that greater age (≥50 years) 
      at initial diagnosis (OR = 3.74, p = 0.0003), higher tumor differentiation scores 
      (OR = 12.09, p = 0.002), and higher tumor necrosis scores (OR = 3.65, p = 0.026) 
      were significantly associated with metastases. Older patients (≥50 years, OR = 
      4.76, p = 0.017), patients with larger tumors (≥5 cm or ≥10 cm, OR = 2.12, p = 
      0.02, OR = 1.92, p = 0.029, respectively), higher differentiation scores (OR = 
      15.92, p = 0.013), and higher necrosis scores (OR = 4.68, p = 0.044) show worse 
      survival outcomes. Analysis of imaging modality during initial staging and during 
      surveillance showed greater tumor detection frequency when PET imaging was 
      employed, compared to CT imaging (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, truncal and 
      peripheral extremity LMS is an aggressive tumor with high metastatic potential 
      and mortality. While there is a significant risk of metastases to lungs, 
      extra-pulmonary tumors are relatively frequent, and broad surveillance may be 
      warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes in 
      patients with associated both column (ABC) acetabular fractures with fracture of 
      the posterior wall (PW), in which the PW underwent reduction and 
      fragment-specific fixation versus those that were treated with column fixation 
      alone. Secondary aims were to assess PW fracture incidence and morphology, as 
      well as to compare radiographic outcomes including fracture healing and interval 
      displacement of the PW in those that did and did not undergo fragment-specific 
      fixation of the PW. METHODS: This was a retrospective series of ABC acetabular 
      fractures treated at a single Level I trauma center. Separate fractures of the PW 
      were identified, and associated features were assessed. Associated both column 
      fractures that underwent reduction and fragment-specific fixation of the PW where 
      then compared to ABC fractures with PW involvement that underwent column 
      reconstruction alone. Radiographic and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: 
      Fractures of the PW occurred in 55.7% of ABC fractures and were associated with 
      central displacement of the femoral head. The majority of PW fractures were large 
      and involved the acetabular roof. All PW fractures healed without displacement by 
      3 months, regardless of whether or not reduction and stabilization was performed. 
      Mid-term outcomes at 1-year were similar regardless of whether or not the PW was 
      reduced and stabilized, with regards to Tönnis grade, Merle d'Aubigné-Postel 
      score, and conversion to total hip arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Reduction and 
      fragment-specific fixation of the PW component of ABC acetabular fractures did 
      not improve outcomes in this small comparative study. Posterior wall fractures 
      associated with ABC patterns are frequently large-sized fragments that involve 
      the acetabular roof and are rendered stable after reconstruction of the columns.

TI  - Tranexamic acid does not affect intraoperative blood loss or in-hospital outcomes 
      after acetabular fracture surgery.
PG  - 363-369

AB  - PURPOSE: Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces need for transfusion in total joint 
      arthroplasty, though findings in acetabular surgery are conflicting. We compared 
      outcomes after acetabular fracture surgery with or without perioperative 
      intravenous (IV) TXA administration. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review 
      of 305 patients with acetabular fractures that underwent open reduction and 
      internal fixation (ORIF). Eighty-nine patients received TXA, and 216 did not. The 
      primary outcome was rates of intraoperative and postoperative allogeneic blood 
      transfusion. RESULTS: Baseline demographics and characteristics were similar. 
      Time from injury to surgery and estimated blood loss were comparable. Operative 
      time (p < 0.01) and intraoperative IV fluids (p < 0.01) were greater in the 
      non-TXA group. The proportion of patients who received blood transfusion and mean 
      units transfused intraoperatively and postoperatively did not differ. Mean 
      differences in preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit, hospital 
      length of stay, and perioperative complications also did not differ. In a 
      multivariable regression model, age 60-70 years, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 
      Injury Severity Score, and fracture patterns likely to bleed were independently 
      associated with intraoperative transfusion. Anterior surgical approaches and 
      intraoperative transfusion requirement were independently associated with 
      postoperative transfusion. CONCLUSION: In this study, perioperative IV TXA did 
      not decrease blood loss, need for transfusion, or improve in-hospital outcomes of 
      acetabular fracture surgery. Age 60-70, CCI, ISS, and fracture patterns likely to 
      bleed were independently associated with intraoperative transfusion. Anterior 
      surgical approach and need for intraoperative transfusion were independently 
      associated with postoperative transfusion. Further prospective trials are 
      warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Spinal cord injury: a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      microRNA alterations.
PG  - 61

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with no current 
      neurorestorative treatments. Clinical trials have been hampered by a lack of 
      meaningful diagnostic and prognostic markers of injury severity and neurologic 
      recovery. Objective biomarkers and novel therapies for SCI represent urgent unmet 
      clinical needs. Biomarkers of SCI that objectively stratify the severity of cord 
      damage could expand the depth and scope of clinical trials and represent targets 
      for the development of novel therapies for acute SCI. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
      represent promising candidates both as informative molecules of injury severity 
      and recovery, and as therapeutic targets. miRNAs are small, regulatory RNA 
      molecules that are tissue-specific and evolutionarily conserved across species. 
      miRNAs have been shown to represent powerful predictors of pathology, 
      particularly with respect to neurologic disorders. METHODS: Studies investigating 
      miRNA alterations in all species of animal models and human studies of acute, 
      traumatic SCI will be identified from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. We aim to 
      identify whether SCI is associated with a specific pattern of miRNA expression 
      that is conserved across species, and whether SCI is associated with a tissue- or 
      cell type-specific pattern of miRNA expression. The inclusion criteria for this 
      study will include (1) studies published anytime, (2) including all species, and 
      sexes with acute, traumatic SCI, (3) relating to the alteration of miRNA after 
      SCI, using molecular-based detection platforms including qRT-PCR, microarray, and 
      RNA-sequencing, (4) including statistically significant miRNA alterations in 
      tissues, such as spinal cord, serum/plasma, and/or CSF, and (5) studies with a 
      SHAM surgery group. Articles included in the review will have their titles, 
      abstracts, and full texts reviewed by two independent authors. Random effects 
      meta-regression will be performed, which allows for within-study and 
      between-study variability, on the miRNA expression after SCI or SHAM surgery. We 
      will analyze both the cumulative pooled dataset, as well as datasets stratified 
      by species, tissue type, and timepoint to identify miRNA alterations that are 
      specifically related to the injured spinal cord. We aim to identify SCI-related 
      miRNA that are specifically altered both within a species, and those that are 
      evolutionarily conserved across species, including humans. The analyses will 
      provide a description of the evolutionarily conserved miRNA signature of the 
      pathophysiological response to SCI. DISCUSSION: Here, we present a protocol to 
      perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the conserved inter- 
      and intra-species miRNA changes that occur due to acute, traumatic SCI. This 
      review seeks to serve as a valuable resource for the SCI community by 
      establishing a rigorous and unbiased description of miRNA changes after SCI for 
      the next generation of SCI biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: The protocol for the systematic review and meta-analysis has been 
      registered through PROSPERO: CRD42021222552 .

TI  - Indications for cement augmentation in fixation of geriatric intertrochanteric 
      femur fractures: a systematic review of evidence.
PG  - 2533-2544
LID - 10.1007/s00402-021-03872-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Achieving durable mechanical stability in geriatric 
      intertrochanteric proximal femur fractures remains a challenge. Concomitant poor 
      bone quality, unstable fracture patterns, and suboptimal reduction are additional 
      risk factors for early mechanical failure. Cement augmentation of the proximal 
      locking screw or blade is one proposed method to augment implant anchorage. The 
      purpose of this review is to describe the biomechanical and clinical evidence for 
      cement augmentation of geriatric intertrochanteric fractures, and to elaborate 
      indications for cement augmentation. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched 
      for English language studies up to January 2021. Studies that assessed effect of 
      calcium phosphate or methylmethacrylate cement augmentation during open reduction 
      and internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures were included. Studies with 
      sample size < 5, nontraumatic or periprosthetic fractures, and nonunion or 
      revision surgery were excluded. Study selection adhered to PRISMA criteria. 
      RESULTS: 801 studies were identified, of which 40 met study criteria. 9 studies 
      assessed effect of cement augmentation on fracture displacement. All but one 
      found that cement decreased fracture displacement. 10 studies assessed effect of 
      cement augmentation on total load or cycles to failure. All but one demonstrated 
      that augmented implants increased this variable. Complication rates of cement 
      augmentation during ORIF of intertrochanteric fractures ranged from 0 to 47%, 
      while non-augmented implants ranged from 0 to 51%. Reoperation rates ranged from 
      0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 11% in the non-augmented group. 
      Fixation failure ranged from 0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 20% 
      in the non-augmented group. Nonunion ranged from 0 to 3.6% in the 
      cement-augmented group and 0 to 34% in the non-augmented group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Calcium phosphate or PMMA-augmented CMN fixation of IT fractures increased 
      construct stability and improved outcomes in biomechanical and early clinical 
      studies. The findings of these studies suggest an important role for cement 
      augmentation in patient populations at high risk of mechanical failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acetabular fracture open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is 
      generally associated with high intraoperative blood loss. Hypotensive anesthesia 
      has been shown to decrease blood loss and intraoperative transfusion in total 
      joint arthroplasty and posterior spinal fusion. In this study, we assessed the 
      effect of reduction in intraoperative mean arterial pressures (MAPs) during 
      acetabular fracture surgery on intraoperative blood loss and need for 
      transfusion. METHODS: Three hundred and one patients with acetabular fractures 
      who underwent ORIF at an academic Level 1 trauma center were retrospectively 
      reviewed. Patients were separated based on mean intraoperative MAPs (<60 mmHg, 
      60-70 mmHg, >70 mmHg). Thirteen patients had mean intraoperative MAP <60 mmHg, 95 
      had MAP 60-70 mmHg, and 193 had MAP >70 mmHg. Rates of intraoperative and 
      postoperative allogeneic blood transfusion were compared. RESULTS: Mean 
      intraoperative MAPs were significantly different between groups (p < 0.0001). 
      Time from injury to surgery, estimated blood loss, operative time and 
      intraoperative IV fluids were comparable. The proportion of patients who received 
      blood transfusion and mean units transfused intraoperatively and postoperatively 
      were similar between groups. Mean differences in preoperative and postoperative 
      hemoglobin and hematocrit were also similar. There was no difference in hospital 
      length of stay or perioperative complications between the groups. Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis demonstrated that body mass index > 30 (p < 0.05) 
      and anterior surgical approach (p < 0.01) were independently associated with 
      intraoperative transfusion and an anterior surgical approach (p < 0.001) was 
      independently associated with postoperative transfusion. CONCLUSION: Decreased 
      intraoperative MAP during acetabular fracture surgery does not reduce blood loss 
      or need for transfusion. On the other hand, no increased end-organ ischemia was 
      seen with hypotensive anesthesia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

AB  - Intra-articular screw cut-out is a potential complication of intertrochanteric 
      femur fracture fixation with a cephalomedullary nail. Cement augmentation of 
      fixation in the proximal segment offers the prospect of increased stability and 
      fewer complications, but clinical experience with non-resorbable cement is 
      limited. To determine the handling properties and efficacy of this new technique, 
      we performed a retrospective propensity-matched cohort of forty-four geriatric 
      intertrochanteric femur fractures treated with a cephalomedullary nail with 
      (n = 11) or without (n = 33) augmentation with non-resorbable cement injected 
      into the proximal segment. In the patients treated with cement augmentation, at 
      minimum 3-month follow-up, there were no instances of intra-articular cut-out, 
      and no increase in re-operation compared to conventional fixation. Cement 
      augmentation appears to be safe and effective in geriatric intertrochanteric 
      femur fractures to mitigate risk of cut-out.

AB  - Chronic high-thoracic and cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a complex 
      phenotype of cardiovascular consequences, including impaired left ventricular 
      (LV) contractility. Here, we aim to determine whether such dysfunction manifests 
      immediately post-injury, and if so, whether correcting impaired contractility can 
      improve spinal cord oxygenation (SCO(2)), blood flow (SCBF) and metabolism. Using 
      a porcine model of T2 SCI, we assess LV end-systolic elastance (contractility) 
      via invasive pressure-volume catheterization, monitor intraparenchymal SCO(2) and 
      SCBF with fiberoptic oxygen sensors and laser-Doppler flowmetry, respectively, 
      and quantify spinal cord metabolites with microdialysis. We demonstrate that 
      high-thoracic SCI acutely impairs cardiac contractility and substantially reduces 
      SCO(2) and SCBF within the first hours post-injury. Utilizing the same model, we 
      next show that augmenting LV contractility with the β-agonist dobutamine 
      increases SCO(2) and SCBF more effectively than vasopressor therapy, whilst also 
      mitigating increased anaerobic metabolism and hemorrhage in the injured cord. 
      Finally, in pigs with T2 SCI survived for 12 weeks post-injury, we confirm that 
      acute hemodynamic management with dobutamine appears to preserve cardiac function 
      and improve hemodynamic outcomes in the chronic setting. Our data support that 
      cardio-centric hemodynamic management represents an advantageous alternative to 
      the current clinical standard of vasopressor therapy for acute traumatic SCI.

TI  - Characterization of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction after Thoracic Spinal Cord 
      Injury in Yucatan Minipigs.
PG  - 1306-1326
LID - 10.1089/neu.2020.7404 [doi]
AB  - There is an increasing need to develop approaches that will not only improve the 
      clinical management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) after 
      spinal cord injury (SCI), but also advance therapeutic interventions aimed at 
      recovering bladder function. Although pre-clinical research frequently employs 
      rodent SCI models, large animals such as the pig may play an important 
      translational role in facilitating the development of devices or treatments. 
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a urodynamics protocol to 
      characterize NLUTD in a porcine model of SCI. An iterative process to develop the 
      protocol to perform urodynamics in female Yucatan minipigs began with a group of 
      spinally intact, anesthetized pigs. Subsequently, urodynamic studies were 
      performed in a group of awake, lightly restrained pigs, before and after a 
      contusion-compression SCI at the T2 or T9-T11 spinal cord level. Bladder tissue 
      was obtained for histological analysis at the end of the study. All anesthetized 
      pigs had bladders that were acontractile, which resulted in overflow incontinence 
      once capacity was reached. Uninjured, conscious pigs demonstrated appropriate 
      relaxation and contraction of the external urethral sphincter during the voiding 
      phase. SCI pigs demonstrated neurogenic detrusor overactivity and a significantly 
      elevated post-void residual volume. Relative to the control, SCI bladders were 
      heavier and thicker. The developed urodynamics protocol allows for repetitive 
      evaluation of lower urinary tract function in pigs at different time points 
      post-SCI. This technique manifests the potential for using the pig as an 
      intermediary, large animal model for translational studies in NLUTD.

      INTERVENTION: GMM preservation or debridement during acetabular fracture surgery 
      through a single-posterior approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes 
      were incidence and severity of HO. Reoperation for HO excision was assessed. 
      Other risk factors for severe HO (Brooker class III-IV) were secondarily assessed 
      using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
      confidence intervals were calculated. The significance was set at P-value ≤ 0.05. 
      RESULTS: There was no difference in the incidence or severity of HO between the 
      debrided and preserved groups. Rates of reoperation for HO excision were 
      comparable. American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class (OR = 
      3.3), head injury (OR = 4.6), and abdominal injury (OR = 4.5) were associated 
      with severe HO. CONCLUSION: GMM debridement was not associated with a decreased 
      incidence of HO after acetabular fracture surgery. American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists class is a novel risk factor associated with severe HO 
      formation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors 
      for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Characterization of the gut microbiome in a porcine model of thoracic spinal cord

AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is a diverse network of bacteria which inhabit our 
      digestive tract and is crucial for efficient cellular metabolism, nutrient 
      absorption, and immune system development. Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts 
      autonomic function below the level of injury and can alter the composition of the 
      gut microbiome. Studies in rodent models have shown that SCI-induced bacterial 
      imbalances in the gut can exacerbate the spinal cord damage and impair recovery. 
      In this study we, for the first time, characterized the composition of the gut 
      microbiome in a Yucatan minipig SCI model. We compared the relative abundance of 
      the most dominant bacterial phyla in control samples to those collected from 
      animals who underwent a contusion-compression SCI at the 2nd or 10th Thoracic 
      level. RESULTS: We identify specific bacterial fluctuations that are unique to 
      SCI animals, which were not found in uninjured animals given the same dietary 
      regimen or antibiotic administration. Further, we identified a specific 
      time-frame, "SCI-acute stage", during which many of these bacterial fluctuations 
      occur before returning to "baseline" levels. CONCLUSION: This work presents a 
      dynamic view of the microbiome changes that accompany SCI, establishes a resource 
      for future studies and to understand the changes that occur to gut microbiota 
      after spinal cord injury and may point to a potential therapeutic target for 
      future treatment.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition for which there 
      are currently no effective treatment options to restore function. A major 
      obstacle to the development of new therapies is our fragmentary understanding of 
      the coordinated pathophysiological processes triggered by damage to the human 
      spinal cord. Here, we describe a systems biology approach to integrate decades of 
      small-scale experiments with unbiased, genome-wide gene expression from the human 
      spinal cord, revealing a gene regulatory network signature of the 
      pathophysiological response to SCI. Our integrative analyses converge on an 
      evolutionarily conserved gene subnetwork enriched for genes associated with the 
      response to SCI by small-scale experiments, and whose expression is upregulated 
      in a severity-dependent manner following injury and downregulated in functional 
      recovery. We validate the severity-dependent upregulation of this subnetwork in 
      rodents in primary transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Our analysis provides 
      systems-level view of the coordinated molecular processes activated in response 
      to SCI.

PG  - 539-547

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) research has recently focused on the use of 
      rat and mouse models for in vivo SCI experiments. Such small rodent SCI models 
      are invaluable for the field, and much has been discovered about the biologic and 
      physiologic aspects of SCI from these models. It has been difficult, however, to 
      reproduce the efficacy of treatments found to produce neurologic benefits in 
      rodent SCI models when these treatments are tested in human clinical trials. A 
      large animal model may have advantages for translational research where 
      anatomical, physiological, or genetic similarities to humans may be more relevant 
      for pre-clinically evaluating novel therapies. Here, we review the work carried 
      out at the University of British Columbia (UBC) on a large animal model of SCI 
      that utilizes Yucatan miniature pigs. The UBC porcine model of SCI may be a 
      useful intermediary in the pre-clinical testing of novel pharmacological 
      treatments, cell-based therapies, and the "bedside back to bench" translation of 
      human clinical observations, which require preclinical testing in an applicable 
      animal model.

AB  - Small animals do not replicate the severity of the human foreign-body response 
      (FBR) to implants. Here we show that the FBR can be driven by forces generated at 
      the implant surface that, owing to allometric scaling, increase exponentially 
      with body size. We found that the human FBR is mediated by immune-cell-specific 
      RAC2 mechanotransduction signalling, independently of the chemistry and 
      mechanical properties of the implant, and that a pathological FBR that is 
      human-like at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels can be induced in mice 
      via the application of human-tissue-scale forces through a vibrating silicone 
      implant. FBRs to such elevated extrinsic forces in the mice were also mediated by 
      the activation of Rac2 signalling in a subpopulation of mechanoresponsive myeloid 
      cells, which could be substantially reduced via the pharmacological or genetic 
      inhibition of Rac2. Our findings provide an explanation for the stark differences 
      in FBRs observed in small animals and humans, and have implications for the 
      design and safety of implantable devices.

TI  - Cephalomedullary helical blade is independently associated with less collapse in 
      intertrochanteric femur fractures than lag screws.
PG  - 1421-1425

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Excessive fracture site collapse and shortening in intertrochanteric 
      femur fractures alter hip biomechanics and patient outcomes. The purpose of the 
      study was to compare extent of collapse in cephalomedullary nails with blades or 
      lag screws. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in collapse between 
      helical blades and lag screws. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 
      Single U.S. Level I Trauma Center. PATIENTS: 171 consecutive patients treated 
      with cephalomedullary nails with either lag screw or blade for AO/OTA 31A1-3 
      proximal femur fractures and minimum 3-month follow-up. INTERVENTION: Lag screw 
      or helical blade in a cephalomedullary nail. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was fracture site collapse at 3 months. RESULTS: There was a 
      significantly higher proportion of reverse-oblique and transverse 
      intertrochanteric femur fractures (31-A3) in the lag screw group (15/42 vs 
      25/129). A3 patterns were associated with more collapse. There was significantly 
      less collapse in the blade group (median 4.7 mm, inter-quartile range 2.5-7.8 mm) 
      than the screw group (median 8.4 mmm, inter-quartile range 3.7-11.2 mm, p 0.006). 
      Median collapse was no different between blades and screws when comparing stable 
      and unstable patterns. However, blades were independently associated with 2.5 mm 
      less collapse (95%CI - 4.2, - 0.72 mm, p 0.006) and lower likelihood of excessive 
      collapse (> 10 mm at 3 months, OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.13-0.74, p 0.007), regardless of 
      fracture pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Helical blades are independently associated with 
      significantly less collapse than lag screws in intertrochanteric proximal femur 
      fractures, after adjusting for unstable fracture patterns. In fracture patterns 
      at risk for collapse, surgeons can consider use of a helical blade due to its 
      favorable sliding properties compared to screws.

TI  - Countersinking the Lag Screw or Blade During Cephalomedullary Nailing of 
      Geriatric Intertrochanteric Femur Fractures: Less Collapse and Implant Prominence 
      Without Increased Cutout Rates.
PG  - e83-e90
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-D-20-01029 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The lag screw or helical blade of a cephalomedullary nail 
      facilitates controlled collapse of intertrochanteric proximal femur fractures. 
      However, excessive collapse results in decreased hip offset and symptomatic 
      lateral implants. Countersinking the screw or helical blade past the lateral 
      cortex may minimize subsequent prominence, but some surgeons are concerned that 
      this will prevent collapse and result in failure through cutout. We hypothesized 
      that patients with countersunk lag screws or helical blades do not experience 
      higher rates of screw or blade cutout and have less implant prominence after 
      fracture healing. METHODS: A retrospective review of 175 consecutive patients 
      treated with cephalomedullary nails for AO/OTA 31A1-3 proximal femur fractures 
      and a minimum 3-month follow-up and 254 patients with a 6-week follow-up at a 
      single US level I trauma center. Patients were stratified based on countersunk 
      versus noncountersunk lag screw or helical blade in a cephalomedullary nail. The 
      primary outcome was the cutout rate at minimum 3 months, and the secondary 
      outcome was radiographic collapse at minimum 6 weeks. RESULTS: Cutout rates were 
      no different in patients with countersunk and noncountersunk screws and blades, 
      and countersinking was associated with less collapse and less implant prominence 
      at 6 weeks. DISCUSSION: Surgeons can countersink the lag screw or blade when 
      treating intertrochanteric proximal femur fractures with a cephalomedullary nail 
      without increasing failure rates and with the potential benefits of less 
      prominent lateral implants and decreased collapse.

TI  - Duraplasty in Traumatic Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury: Impact on Spinal Cord 
      Hemodynamics, Tissue Metabolism, Histology, and Behavioral Recovery Using a 
      Porcine Model.
PG  - 2937-2955
LID - 10.1089/neu.2021.0084 [doi]
AB  - After acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), the spinal cord can swell to fill 
      the subarachnoid space and become compressed by the surrounding dura. In a 
      porcine model of SCI, we performed a duraplasty to expand the subarachnoid space 
      around the injured spinal cord and evaluated how this influenced acute 
      intraparenchymal hemodynamic and metabolic responses, in addition to histological 
      and behavioral recovery. Female Yucatan pigs underwent a T10 SCI, with or without 
      duraplasty. Using microsensors implanted into the spinal cord parenchyma, changes 
      in blood flow (ΔSCBF), oxygenation (ΔPO(2)), and spinal cord pressure (ΔSCP) 
      during and after SCI were monitored, alongside metabolic responses. Behavioral 
      recovery was tested weekly using the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS). 
      Thereafter, spinal cords were harvested for tissue sparing analyses. In both 
      duraplasty and non-animals, the ΔSCP increased ∼5 mm Hg in the first 6 h 
      post-injury. After this, the SCP appeared to be slightly reduced in the 
      duraplasty animals, although the group differences were not statistically 
      significant after controlling for injury severity in terms of impact force. 
      During the first seven days post-SCI, the ΔSCBF or ΔPO(2) values were not 
      different between the duraplasty and control animals. Over 12 weeks, there was no 
      improvement in hindlimb locomotion as assessed by PTIBS scores and no reduction 
      in tissue damage at the injury site in the duraplasty animals. In our porcine 
      model of SCI, duraplasty did not provide any clear evidence of long-term 
      behavioral or tissue sparing benefit after SCI.

TI  - Lateral Distractor Use During Internal Fixation of Tibial Plateau Fractures Has a 
      Minimal Risk of Iatrogenic Peroneal Nerve Palsy.
PG  - e51-e55
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000001875 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of iatrogenic peroneal nerve palsy after 
      application of an intraoperative lateral distractor during open reduction and 
      internal fixation of tibial plateau fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective review. 
      SETTING: Single academic Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-seven 
      patients met criteria and were included in the study. INTERVENTION: Patients with 
      unicondylar and bicondylar tibial plateau fractures underwent open reduction and 
      internal fixation and received application of an intraoperative lateral 
      distractor to aid in visualization and reduction of the impacted lateral plateau. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of iatrogenic peroneal nerve palsy. RESULTS: 
      There was a 2.0% incidence of iatrogenic peroneal nerve symptoms (3 of 147 
      patients), most of which were incomplete sensory deficits. There was no 
      association with staged external fixation, regional anesthesia, or tourniquet 
      use. CONCLUSION: Use of an intraoperative lateral distractor is safe and has a 
      low incidence of iatrogenic peroneal nerve palsy if applied carefully. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete 
      description of levels of evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lateral decubitus single position anterior-posterior (AP) 
      fusion utilizing anterior lumbar interbody fusion and percutaneous posterior 
      fixation is a novel, minimally invasive surgical technique. Single position 
      lumbar surgery (SPLS) with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) or lateral 
      lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) has been shown to be a safe, effective technique. 
      This study directly compares perioperative outcomes of SPLS with lateral ALIF vs. 
      traditional supine ALIF with repositioning (FLIP) for degenerative pathologies. 
      PURPOSE: To determine if SPLS with lateral ALIF improves perioperative outcomes 
      compared to FLIP with supine ALIF. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Multicenter 
      retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients undergoing primary AP 
      fusions with ALIF at 5 institutions from 2015 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels 
      fused, inclusion of L4-L5, L5-S1, radiation dosage, operative time, estimated 
      blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), perioperative complications. Radiographic 
      analysis included lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), and PI-LL 
      mismatch. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of primary ALIFs with bilateral 
      percutaneous pedicle screw fixation between L4-S1 over 5 years at 5 institutions. 
      Patients were grouped as FLIP or SPLS. Demographic, procedural, perioperative, 
      and radiographic outcome measures were compared using independent samples t-tests 
      and chi-squared analyses with significance set at p <.05. Cohorts were 
      propensity-matched for demographic or procedural differences. RESULTS: A total of 
      321 patients were included; 124 SPS and 197 Flip patients. Propensity-matching 
      yielded 248 patients: 124 SPLS and 124 FLIP. The SPLS cohort demonstrated 
      significantly reduced operative time (132.95±77.45 vs. 261.79±91.65 min; p 
      <0.001), EBL (120.44±217.08 vs. 224.29±243.99 mL; p <.001), LOS (2.07±1.26 vs. 
      3.47±1.40 days; p <.001), and rate of perioperative ileus (0.00% vs. 6.45%; p 
      =.005). Radiation dose (39.79±31.66 vs. 37.54±35.85 mGy; p =.719) and 
      perioperative complications including vascular injury (1.61% vs. 1.61%; p =.000), 
      retrograde ejaculation (0.00% vs. 0.81%, p =.328), abdominal wall (0.81% vs. 
      2.42%; p =.338), neuropraxia (1.61% vs. 0.81%; p =.532), persistent motor deficit 
      (0.00% vs. 1.61%; p =.166), wound complications (1.61% vs. 1.61%; p =.000), or 
      VTE (0.81% vs. 0.81%; p =.972) were similar. No difference was seen in 90-day 
      return to OR. Similar results were noted in sub-analyses of single-level L4-L5 or 
      L5-S1 fusions. On radiographic analysis, the SPLS cohort had greater changes in 
      LL (4.23±11.14 vs. 0.43±8.07 deg; p =.005) and PI-LL mismatch (-4.78±8.77 vs. 
      -0.39±7.51 deg; p =.002). CONCLUSIONS: Single position lateral ALIF with 
      percutaneous posterior fixation improves operative time, EBL, LOS, rate of ileus, 
      and maintains safety compared to supine ALIF with prone percutaneous pedicle 
      screws between L4-S1.

AB  - Therapeutic development for spinal cord injury is hindered by the difficulty in 
      conducting clinical trials, which to date have relied solely on functional 
      outcome measures for patient enrollment, stratification, and evaluation. 
      Biological biomarkers that accurately classify injury severity and predict 
      neurologic outcome would represent a paradigm shift in the way spinal cord injury 
      clinical trials could be conducted. MicroRNAs have emerged as attractive 
      biomarker candidates due to their stability in biological fluids, their 
      phylogenetic similarities, and their tissue specificity. Here we characterized a 
      porcine model of spinal cord injury using a combined behavioural, histological, 
      and molecular approach. We performed next-generation sequencing on microRNAs in 
      serum samples collected before injury and then at 1, 3, and 5 days post injury. 
      We identified 58, 21, 9, and 7 altered miRNA after severe, moderate, and mild 
      spinal cord injury, and SHAM surgery, respectively. These data were combined with 
      behavioural and histological analysis. Overall miRNA expression at 1 and 3 days 
      post injury strongly correlates with outcome measures at 12 weeks post injury. 
      The data presented here indicate that serum miRNAs are promising candidates as 
      biomarkers for the evaluation of injury severity for spinal cord injury or other 
      forms of traumatic, acute, neurologic injury.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with variability in injury 
      mechanisms and neurologic recovery. Spinal cord impairment after SCI is measured 
      and classified by a widely accepted standard neurological examination. In the 
      very acute stages post-injury, however, this examination is extremely challenging 
      (and often impossible) to conduct and has modest prognostic value in terms of 
      neurological recovery. The lack of objective tools to classify injury severity 
      and predict outcome is a barrier for clinical trials and thwarts development of 
      therapies for those with SCI. Biological markers (biomarkers) represent a 
      promising, complementary approach to these challenges because they represent an 
      unbiased approach to classify injury severity and predict neurological outcome. 
      Identification of a suitable panel of molecular biomarkers would comprise a 
      fundamental shift in how patients with acute SCI are evaluated, stratified, and 
      treated in clinical trials. MicroRNA are attractive biomarker candidates in 
      neurological disorders for several reasons, including their stability in 
      biological fluids, their conservation between humans and model mammals, and their 
      tissue specificity. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to identify 
      microRNA associated with injury severity within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
      serum of human patients with acute SCI. The CSF and serum samples were obtained 
      1-5 days post-injury from 39 patients with acute SCI (24 American Spinal Injury 
      Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A, 8 AIS B, 7 AIS C) and from five non-SCI 
      controls. We identified a severity-dependent pattern of change in microRNA 
      expression in CSF and identified a set of microRNA that are diagnostic of 
      baseline AIS classification and prognostic of neurological outcome six months 
      post-injury. The data presented here provide a comprehensive description of the 
      CSF and serum microRNA expression changes that occur after acute human SCI. This 
      data set reveals microRNA candidates that warrant further evaluation as 
      biomarkers of injury severity after SCI and as key regulators in other 
      neurological disorders.

AB  - One of the only currently available treatment options to potentially improve 
      neurological recovery after acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is augmentation of 
      mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to promote blood flow and oxygen delivery to 
      the injured cord. However, to optimize such hemodynamic management, clinicians 
      require a method to monitor the physiological effects of these MAP alterations 
      within the injured cord. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility and 
      effectiveness of using a novel optical sensor, based on near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (NIRS), to monitor real-time spinal cord oxygenation and 
      hemodynamics during the first 7 days post-injury in a porcine model of acute SCI. 
      Six Yucatan miniature pigs underwent a T10 vertebral level contusion-compression 
      injury. Spinal cord oxygenation and hemodynamics were continuously monitored by a 
      minimally invasive custom-made NIRS sensor, and by invasive intraparenchymal (IP) 
      probes to validate the NIRS measures. Episodes of MAP alteration and hypoxia were 
      performed acutely after injury, and at 2 and 7 days post-injury to simulate the 
      types of hemodynamic changes SCI patients experience after injury. The NIRS 
      sensor demonstrated the ability to provide oxygenation and hemodynamic 
      measurements over the 7-day post-SCI period. NIRS measures showed statistically 
      significant correlations with each of the invasive IP measures and MAP changes 
      during episodes of MAP alteration and hypoxia throughout the first week 
      post-injury (p < 0.05). These results indicate that this novel NIRS system can 
      monitor real-time changes in spinal cord oxygenation and hemodynamics over the 
      first 7 days post-injury, and has the ability to detect local tissue changes that 
      are reflective of systemic hemodynamic changes.

TI  - A novel porcine model of traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury.
PG  - 142-59
LID - 10.1089/neu.2012.2386 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) researchers have predominately utilized rodents and mice 
      for in vivo SCI modeling and experimentation. From these small animal models have 
      come many insights into the biology of SCI, and a growing number of novel 
      treatments that promote behavioral recovery. It has, however, been difficult to 
      demonstrate the efficacy of such treatments in human clinical trials. A large 
      animal SCI model that is an intermediary between rodent and human SCI may be a 
      valuable translational research resource for pre-clinically evaluating novel 
      therapies, prior to embarking upon lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Here, 
      we describe the development of such a large animal model. A thoracic spinal cord 
      injury at T10/11 was induced in Yucatan miniature pigs (20-25 kg) using a weight 
      drop device. Varying degrees of injury severity were induced by altering the 
      height of the weight drop (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm). Behavioral recovery 
      over 12 weeks was measured using a newly developed Porcine Thoracic Injury 
      Behavior Scale (PTIBS). This scale distinguished locomotor recovery among animals 
      of different injury severities, with strong intra-observer and inter-observer 
      reliability. Histological analysis of the spinal cords 12 weeks post-injury 
      revealed that animals with the more biomechanically severe injuries had less 
      spared white matter and gray matter and less neurofilament immunoreactivity. 
      Additionally, the PTIBS scores correlated strongly with the extent of tissue 
      sparing through the epicenter of injury. This large animal model of SCI may 
      represent a useful intermediary in the testing of novel pharmacological 
      treatments and cell transplantation strategies.

TI  - Differences in Morphometric Measures of the Uninjured Porcine Spinal Cord and 
      Dural Sac Predict Histological and Behavioral Outcomes after Traumatic Spinal 
      Cord Injury.
PG  - 3005-3017
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.5930 [doi]
AB  - One of the challenges associated with conducting experiments in animal models of 
      traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is inducing a consistent injury with minimal 
      variability in the degree of tissue damage and resultant behavioral and 
      biochemical outcomes. We evaluated how the variability in morphometry of the 
      spinal cord and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contributes to the 
      variability in behavioral and histological outcomes in our porcine model of SCI. 
      Using intraoperative ultrasound imaging, spinal cord morphometry was assessed in 
      seven Yucatan minipigs undergoing a weight-drop T10 contusion-compression injury. 
      Bivariate and multi-variate analysis and modeling were used to identify native 
      morphometrical determinants of interanimal variability in histological and 
      behavioral outcomes. The measured biomechanical impact parameters did not 
      correlate with the histological measures or hindlimb locomotor behavior (Porcine 
      Thoracic Injury Behavior Scale). In contrast, clear associations were revealed 
      between CSF layer morphometry and the amount of white matter and tissue sparing. 
      Specifically, the dorsoventral diameter of the dural sac and ventral CSF space 
      were strong predictors of behavioral and histological outcome and together 
      explained ≥95.0% of the variance in these parameters. In addition, a dorsoventral 
      diameter of the spinal cord less than 5.331 mm was a strong contributing factor 
      to poor behavioral recovery over 12 weeks. These results indicate that 
      interanimal variability in cord morphometry provides a potential biological 
      explanation for the observed heterogeneity in histological and behavioral 
      outcomes. Such knowledge is helpful for appropriately balancing experimental 
      groups, and/or varying impact parameters to match cord and CSF layer dimensions 
      for future studies.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers many perturbations within the injured 
      cord, such as decreased perfusion, reduced tissue oxygenation, increased 
      hydrostatic pressure, and disrupted bioenergetics. While much attention is 
      directed to neuroprotective interventions that might alleviate these early 
      pathophysiologic responses to traumatic injury, the temporo-spatial 
      characteristics of these responses within the injured cord are not well 
      documented. In this study, we utilized our Yucatan mini-pig model of traumatic 
      SCI to characterize intraparenchymal hemodynamic and metabolic changes within the 
      spinal cord for 1 week post-injury. Animals were subjected to a 
      contusion/compression SCI at T10. Prior to injury, probes for microdialysis and 
      the measurement of spinal cord blood flow (SCBF), oxygenation (in partial 
      pressure of oxygen; PaPO(2)), and hydrostatic pressure were inserted into the 
      spinal cord 0.2 and 2.2 cm from the injury site. Measurements occurred under 
      anesthesia for 4 h post-injury, after which the animals were recovered and 
      measurements continued for 7 days. Close to the lesion (0.2 cm), SCBF levels 
      decreased immediately after SCI, followed by an increase in the subsequent days. 
      Similarly, PaPO(2) plummeted, where levels remained diminished for up to 7 days 
      post-injury. Lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio increased within minutes. Further away 
      from the injury site (2.2 cm), L/P ratio also gradually increased. Hydrostatic 
      pressure remained consistently elevated for days and negatively correlated with 
      changes in SCBF. An imbalance between SCBF and tissue metabolism also was 
      observed, resulting in metabolic stress and insufficient oxygen levels. Taken 
      together, traumatic SCI resulted in an expanding area of ischemia/hypoxia, with 
      ongoing physiological perturbations sustained out to 7 days post-injury. This 
      suggests that our clinical practice of hemodynamically supporting patients out to 
      7 days post-injury may fail to address persistent ischemia within the injured 
      cord. A detailed understanding of these pathophysiological mechanisms after SCI 
      is essential to promote best practices for acute SCI patients.

TI  - Responses of the Acutely Injured Spinal Cord to Vibration that Simulates 
      Transport in Helicopters or Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected Vehicles.
PG  - 2217-2226
AB  - In the military environment, injured soldiers undergoing medical evacuation via 
      helicopter or mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle (MRAP) are subjected to 
      vibration and shock inherent to the transport vehicle. We conducted the present 
      study to assess the consequences of such vibration on the acutely injured spinal 
      cord. We used a porcine model of spinal cord injury (SCI). After a T10 
      contusion-compression injury, animals were subjected to 1) no vibration 
      (n = 7-8), 2) whole body vibration at frequencies and amplitudes simulating 
      helicopter transport (n = 8), or 3) whole body vibration simulating ground 
      transportation in an MRAP ambulance (n = 7). Hindlimb locomotor function (using 
      Porcine Thoracic Injury Behavior Scale [PTIBS]), Eriochrome Cyanine 
      histochemistry and biochemical analysis of inflammatory and neural damage markers 
      were analyzed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) expression levels for monocyte 
      chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein (GFAP) were similar between the helicopter or MRAP group and the 
      unvibrated controls. Spared white/gray matter tended to be lower in the 
      MRAP-vibrated animals than in the unvibrated controls, especially rostral to the 
      epicenter. However, spared white/gray matter in the helicopter-vibrated group 
      appeared normal. Although there was a relationship between the extent of sparing 
      and the extent of locomotor recovery, no significant differences were found in 
      PTIBS scores between the groups. In summary, exposures to vibration in the 
      context of ground (MRAP) or aeromedical (helicopter) transportation did not 
      significantly impair functional outcome in our large animal model of SCI. 
      However, MRAP vibration was associated with increased tissue damage around the 
      injury site, warranting caution around exposure to vehicle vibration acutely 
      after SCI.

      cervical spinal cord injury.
PG  - 219-30
LID - 10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.06.018 [doi]
AB  - Minocycline, a commonly prescribed tetracycline antibiotic, has shown promise as 
      a potential therapeutic agent in animal models of numerous neurologic disorders 
      such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, 
      Huntington's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Simvastatin is one of 
      many hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors prescribed to lower 
      cholesterol. These drugs are also known to reduce inflammation and oxidative 
      stress, improve endothelial function, and modulate the immune system in stroke, 
      traumatic brain injury, and SCI. As both drugs have translational potential, we 
      evaluated their neuroprotective properties here in a clinically relevant model of 
      contusive cervical spinal cord injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a unilateral 
      cervical contusion SCI at C5 and were randomized to receive: 1. Minocycline 90 
      mg/kg x 3 days, 2. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days, 3. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 
      days then 5mg/kg x 35 days, or 4. Saline (Control). Behavioral recovery was 
      assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, 
      modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also 
      assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and 
      rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after 
      injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and 
      rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. 
      In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with 
      improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. 
      Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey 
      sensory test were similar among all groups. Animals treated for 42 days with 
      simvastatin scored significantly higher in the grooming score compared to other 
      groups, but retrieved significantly fewer pellets on the modified Montoya 
      staircase test than control and minocycline treated animals. Histologically, 
      there were no significant differences in white and gray matter sparing and in the 
      extent of corticospinal and rubrospinal sprouting between the four groups. In 
      conclusion, both minocycline and simvastatin failed to improve functional and 
      histological recovery in our model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury.

TI  - A contusive model of unilateral cervical spinal cord injury using the infinite 
      horizon impactor.
LID - 3313 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/3313 [doi]
AB  - While the majority of human spinal cord injuries occur in the cervical spinal 
      cord, the vast majority of laboratory research employs animal models of spinal 
      cord injury (SCI) in which the thoracic spinal cord is injured. Additionally, 
      because most human cord injuries occur as the result of blunt, non-penetrating 
      trauma (e.g. motor vehicle accident, sporting injury) where the spinal cord is 
      violently struck by displaced bone or soft tissues, the majority of SCI 
      researchers are of the opinion that the most clinically relevant injury models 
      are those in which the spinal cord is rapidly contused.(1) Therefore, an 
      important step in the preclinical evaluation of novel treatments on their way to 
      human translation is an assessment of their efficacy in a model of contusion SCI 
      within the cervical spinal cord. Here, we describe the technical aspects and 
      resultant anatomical and behavioral outcomes of an unilateral contusive model of 
      cervical SCI that employs the Infinite Horizon spinal cord injury impactor. 
      Sprague Dawley rats underwent a left-sided unilateral laminectomy at C5. To 
      optimize the reproducibility of the biomechanical, functional, and histological 
      outcomes of the injury model, we contused the spinal cords using an impact force 
      of 150 kdyn, an impact trajectory of 22.5° (animals rotated at 22.5°), and an 
      impact location off of midline of 1.4 mm. Functional recovery was assessed using 
      the cylinder rearing test, horizontal ladder test, grooming test and modified 
      Montoya's staircase test for up to 6 weeks, after which the spinal cords were 
      evaluated histologically for white and grey matter sparing. The injury model 
      presented here imparts consistent and reproducible biomechanical forces to the 
      spinal cord, an important feature of any experimental SCI model. This results in 
      discrete histological damage to the lateral half of the spinal cord which is 
      largely contained to the ipsilateral side of injury. The injury is well tolerated 
      by the animals, but does result in functional deficits of the forelimb that are 
      significant and sustained in the weeks following injury. The cervical unilateral 
      injury model presented here may be a resource to researchers who wish to evaluate 
      potentially promising therapies prior to human translation.

TI  - The Evaluation of Magnesium Chloride within a Polyethylene Glycol Formulation in 
      a Porcine Model of Acute Spinal Cord Injury.
PG  - 2202-2216
AB  - A porcine model of spinal cord injury (SCI) was used to evaluate the 
      neuroprotective effects of magnesium chloride (MgCl(2)) within a polyethylene 
      glycol (PEG) formulation, called "AC105" (Acorda Therapeutics Inc., Ardsley, NY). 
      Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that AC105 would lead to greater tissue 
      sparing at the injury site and improved behavioral outcome when delivered in a 
      clinically realistic time window post-injury. Four hours after 
      contusion/compression injury, Yucatan minipigs were randomized to receive a 
      30-min intravenous infusion of AC105, magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)), or saline. 
      Animals received 4 additional infusions of the same dose at 6-h intervals. 
      Behavioral recovery was tested for 12 weeks using two-dimensional (2D) kinematics 
      during weight-supported treadmill walking and the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale 
      (PTIBS), a 10-point locomotion scale. Spinal cords were evaluated ex vivo by 
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subjected to histological 
      analysis. Treatment with AC105 or MgSO(4) did not result in improvements in 
      locomotor recovery on the PTIBS or in 2D kinematics on weight-supported treadmill 
      walking. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed severe loss of tissue integrity 
      at the impact site, with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean 
      diffusivity; this was not improved with AC105 or MgSO(4) treatment. Histological 
      analysis revealed no significant increase in gray or white matter sparing with 
      AC105 or MgSO(4) treatment. Finally, AC105 did not result in higher Mg(2+) levels 
      in CSF than with the use of standard MgSO(4). In summary, when testing AC105 in a 
      porcine model of SCI, we were unable to reproduce the promising therapeutic 
      benefits observed previously in less-severe rodent models of SCI.

TI  - Risk factors and outcomes associated with external ventricular drain infections.
PG  - 1859-1866
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD) is a common 
      neurosurgical procedure which may lead to serious complications including 
      infection. Some risk factors associated with EVD infection are well established. 
      Others remain less certain, including specific indications for placement, prior 
      neurosurgery, and prior EVD placement. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for 
      EVD infections. METHODS: We reviewed all EVD insertions at our institution from 
      March 2015 through May 2019 following implementation of a standardized infection 
      control protocol for EVD insertion and maintenance. Cox regression was used to 
      identify risk factors for EVD infections. RESULTS: 479 EVDs placed in 409 
      patients met inclusion criteria, and 9 culture-positive infections were observed 
      during the study period. The risk of infection within 30 days of EVD placement 
      was 2.2% (2.3 infections/1,000 EVD days). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were 
      identified in 6 of the 9 EVD infections). EVD infection led to prolonged length 
      of stay post-EVD-placement (23 days vs 16 days; P = .045). Cox regression 
      demonstrated increased infection risk in patients with prior brain surgery 
      associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion (HR, 8.08; 95% CI, 1.7-39.4; 
      P = .010), CSF leak around the catheter (HR, 21.0; 95% CI, 7.0-145.1; P = .0007), 
      and insertion site dehiscence (HR, 7.53; 95% CI, 1.04-37.1; P = .0407). Duration 
      of EVD use >7 days was not associated with infection risk (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 
      0.07-5.45; P = .669). CONCLUSION: Risk factors associated with EVD infection 
      include prior brain surgery, CSF leak, and insertion site dehiscence. We found no 
      significant association between infection risk and duration of EVD placement.

TI  - Reducing ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection with intraoperative glove removal.
PG  - 234-237
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contamination of ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) by cutaneous 
      flora, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, is a common cause of shunt 
      infection and failure, leading to prolonged hospital stay, higher costs of care, 
      and poor outcomes. Glove contamination may occur during VPS insertion, increasing 
      risk of such infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed 
      database for studies published January 1, 1970, through August 31, 2021 that 
      documented VPS infection rates before and after implementing a practice of double 
      gloving with change or removal of the outer glove immediately prior to shunt 
      insertion. RESULTS: Among 272 reports screened, 4 were eligible for review based 
      on our inclusion criteria. The incidence of VPS infection was reduced in all 4 
      quasi-experimental studies with an aggregate incidence of VPS infection of 11.8% 
      before the change in intraoperative protocol and 4.9% after protocol change. One 
      study documented reduced hospital stay with this change in protocol. CONCLUSION: 
      The risk of VPS infection is reduced by removal or replacement of the outer 
      surgical gloves immediately prior to intraoperative insertion of a VPS as part of 
      an infection control bundle.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posterior fossa approaches are common neurosurgical procedures. Rates 
      of postoperative infection, pseudomeningocele, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      fistula are high; however, evidence regarding predisposing risk factors and 
      treatment outcomes remain sparse. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was 
      carried out of all posterior fossa surgeries conducted at a single institution 
      between January 2015 and October 2019. Univariate statistical methods and 
      stepwise logistic regression were used to assess which factors contributed most 
      to risk of development of postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 269 
      patients were included; 18.6% experienced any postoperative complication, 13% 
      developed either pseudomeningocele or CSF fistula, and 9.7% developed an 
      infection. In multivariate analysis, development of a pseudomeningocele was 
      significantly associated with previous cranial surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 3.15; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-9.28; P = 0.0391). Development of a CSF 
      fistula was significantly associated with index surgery for resection of neoplasm 
      (HR, 7.65; 95% CI, 1.86-22.31; P = 0.0174). Development of an infection was 
      significantly associated with concurrent CSF fistula (HR, 7.16; 95% CI, 
      1.91-23.19; P = 0.0041) and concurrent pseudomeningocele (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 
      1.37-5.95; P = 0.0082) and nonsignificantly associated with diabetes requiring 
      treatment (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.69-8.50; P = 0.168). Other hypothesized risk 
      factors for these complications, such as nonmidline approaches to the posterior 
      fossa, watertight duraplasty, use of dural fibrin sealant, and cranioplasty were 
      not associated with these complications on multivariate analysis. Although many 
      patients with pseudomeningocele were successfully managed with observation, only 
      38% of patients in whom CSF diversion was attempted avoided surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 
      History of diabetes, cranioplasty, revision surgery, and surgery for tumor 
      resection are identified as risk factors for the development of infection, 
      pseudomeningocele, and CSF fistula, respectively.

AB  - In age-related neurodegenerative diseases, pathology often develops slowly across 
      the lifespan. As one example, in diseases such as Alzheimer's, vascular decline 
      is believed to onset decades ahead of symptomology. However, challenges inherent 
      in current microscopic methods make longitudinal tracking of such vascular 
      decline difficult. Here, we describe a suite of methods for measuring brain 
      vascular dynamics and anatomy in mice for over seven months in the same field of 
      view. This approach is enabled by advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
      and image processing algorithms including deep learning. These integrated methods 
      enabled us to simultaneously monitor distinct vascular properties spanning 
      morphology, topology, and function of the microvasculature across all scales: 
      large pial vessels, penetrating cortical vessels, and capillaries. We have 
      demonstrated this technical capability in wild-type and 3xTg male mice. The 
      capability will allow comprehensive and longitudinal study of a broad range of 
      progressive vascular diseases, and normal aging, in key model systems.

LID - 539
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain abscess is a potentially fatal condition. Orbital fractures 
      caused by penetrating injury may be associated with intracranial infection. Such 
      complication associated with blunt trauma, orbital roof fractures, and 
      odontogenic abscesses is exceedingly rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case 
      of a 40-year-old transgender female with a frontal abscess presenting several 
      weeks following a motor vehicle crash from which she suffered multiple facial 
      fractures and an odontogenic abscess. On computed tomography scan, the patient 
      had multiple right-sided facial fractures, including a medial orbital wall 
      fracture and a right sphenoid fracture extending into the superior orbital roof. 
      There was hemorrhage notable in the right frontal lobe. Communication with the 
      ethmoid sinuses likely provided a conduit for bacterial spread through the orbit 
      and into the intracranial and subdural spaces. CONCLUSION: Skull base fractures 
      that communicate with a sinus, whether it be frontal, ethmoid, or sphenoid may 
      increase the risk of brain abscess, especially in patients who develop an 
      odontogenic abscess. Surgical repair of the defect is essential, and treating 
      patients prophylactically with antibiotics may be beneficial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this retrospective study was to assess differences 
      in the pathogens causing surgical site infections (SSIs) following 
      craniectomies/craniotomies and open spinal surgery. The secondary aim was to 
      assess differences in rates of SSI among these operative procedures. METHODS: 
      ANOVA tests with Bonferroni correction and incidence risk ratios (RRs) were used 
      to identify differences in pathogens by surgical site and procedure using 
      retrospective, de-identified records of 19,993 postneurosurgical patients treated 
      between 2007 and 2020. RESULTS: The overall infection rates for 
      craniotomy/craniectomy, laminectomy, and fusion were 2.1%, 1.1%, and 1.5%, 
      respectively, and overall infection rates for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar 
      spine surgery were 0.3%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively. Craniotomy/craniectomy was 
      more likely to result in an SSI than spine surgery (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.2, p < 
      0.0001). Cutibacterium acnes (RR 24.2, 95% CI 7.3-80.0, p < 0.0001); 
      coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (methicillin-susceptible CoNS: RR 2.9, 
      95% CI 1.6-5.4, p = 0.0006; methicillin-resistant CoNS: RR 5.6, 95% CI 1.4-22.3, 
      p = 0.02); Klebsiella aerogenes (RR 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-25.1, p = 0.0003); Serratia 
      marcescens (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-7.1, p = 0.01); Enterobacter cloacae (RR 3.1, 95% 
      CI 1.2-8.1, p = 0.02); and Candida albicans (RR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.3, p = 0.02) 
      were more commonly associated with craniotomy/craniectomy cases than fusion or 
      laminectomy SSIs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more commonly associated with fusion 
      SSIs than craniotomy SSIs (RR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3-14.8, p = 0.02), whereas 
      Escherichia coli was nonsignificantly associated with fusion SSIs compared to 
      craniotomy SSIs (RR 4.1, 95% CI 0.9-18.1, p = 0.06). Infections with E. coli and 
      P. aeruginosa occurred primarily in the lumbar spine (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0001, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SSIs due to typical gastrointestinal or genitourinary 
      gram-negative bacteria occur most commonly following lumbar surgery, particularly 
      fusion, and are likely to be due to contamination of the surgical bed with 
      microbial flora in the perianal area and genitourinary tract. Cutibacterium acnes 
      in the skin flora of the head and neck increases risk of infection due to this 
      microbe following surgical interventions in these body sites. The types of 
      gram-negative bacteria associated with craniotomy/craniectomy SSIs suggest 
      potential environmental sources of these pathogens. Based on the authors' 
      findings, neurosurgeons should consider using a two-step skin preparation with 
      benzoyl peroxide, in addition to a standard antiseptic such as alcoholic 
      chlorhexidine for cranial, cervical, and upper thoracic surgeries. Additionally, 
      broader gram-negative bacterial coverage, such as use of a third-generation 
      cephalosporin, should be considered for lumbar/lumbosacral fusion surgical 
      antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is a common neurosurgical 
      procedure, and EVD-related infection is a significant complication. We examined 
      the effect of infection control protocol changes on EVD-related infection 
      incidence. METHODS: Changes in EVD placement protocol and incidence density of 
      infections after implementation of protocol changes in the neurocritical care 
      unit were tracked from 2007 to 2019. EVD infections were defined using a modified 
      U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety 
      Network surveillance definition of meningitis/ventriculitis for patients with 
      EVDs in situ for at least 2 days confirmed by positive culture. Contribution of 
      protocol changes to EVD infection risk was assessed via multivariate regression. 
      RESULTS: Fifteen major changes in EVD protocol were associated with a reduction 
      in infections from 6.7 to 2.0 per 1000 EVD days (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      4.1-5.3; P < 0.001). Gram-positive bacterial infection incidence decreased from 
      4.8 to 1.7 per 1000 EVD days (95% CI, 2.3-3.9; P = 0.00882) and gram-negative 
      infection incidence decreased from 1.9 to 0.5 per 1000 EVD days (95% CI, 0.6-2.3; 
      P = 0.0303). Of all protocol changes since 2007, the largest reduction in 
      incidence was 3.9 infections per 1000 days (95% CI, 0.50-7.30; P = 0.011), 
      associated with combined standardization of reduced EVD sampling frequency, 
      cutaneous antisepsis with alcoholic chlorhexidine before EVD placement, and use 
      of a subcutaneous tunneling technique during EVD insertion. CONCLUSIONS: The most 
      significant reduction in EVD infections may be achieved through the combination 
      of reducing EVD sampling frequency and standardizing alcoholic chlorhexidine 
      cutaneous antisepsis and subcutaneous tunneling of the EVD catheter.

TI  - Time of Discharge and 30-Day Re-Presentation to an Acute Care Setting After 
      Elective Lumbar Decompression Surgery.
PG  - 507-514
LID - 10.1227/neu.0000000000002233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the consequence of efforts to increase patient 
      throughput and decrease length of stay in the context of elective spine surgery 
      is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether early time of discharge results in 
      increased rates of hospital readmission or return to emergency department for 
      patients admitted after elective, posterior, lumbar decompression surgery. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 779 patients admitted to 
      hospital after undergoing elective, posterior, lumbar decompression surgery. 
      Multiple logistic regression evaluated the relationship between time of discharge 
      and the primary outcome of return to acute care within 30 days, while controlling 
      for sociodemographic, procedural, and discharge characteristics. RESULTS: In 
      multiple logistic regression, time of discharge earlier in the day was not 
      associated with increased odds of return to acute care within 30 days (odds ratio 
      [OR] 1.18, 95% CI 0.92-1.52, P = .19). Weekend discharge (OR 1.99, 95% CI 
      1.04-3.79, P = .04) increased the likelihood of return to acute care. Surgeon 
      experience (<1 year of attending practice, OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-1.00, P = .05 and 
      2-5 years of attending practice, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-1.01, P = .054), weekend 
      discharge (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89, P = .02), and physical therapy evaluation 
      (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12-0.33, P < .001) decreased the likelihood of discharge 
      before noon. CONCLUSION: Time of discharge is not associated with risk of 
      readmission or presentation to the emergency department after elective lumbar 
      decompression. Weekend discharge is independently associated with increased risk 
      of readmission and decreased likelihood of prenoon discharge.

AB  - Vascular alterations have recently gained some attention with their strong 
      association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a label-free in vivo 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) longitudinal imaging using an AD mouse model. 
      We achieved the tracking of the same individual vessels over time and conducted 
      an in-depth analysis of temporal dynamics in vasculature and vasodynamics using 
      OCT angiography and Doppler-OCT. The AD group showed an exponential decay in both 
      vessel diameter and blood flow change with the critical timepoint before 20 weeks 
      of age, which precedes cognitive decline observed at 40 weeks of age. 
      Interestingly, for the AD group, the diameter change showed the dominance in 
      arterioles over venules, but no such influence was found in blood flow change. 
      Conversely, three mice groups with early vasodilatory intervention did not show 
      any significant change in both vascular integrity and cognitive function compared 
      to the wild-type group. We found early vascular alterations and confirmed their 
      correlation with cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for high-resolution 
      mapping of flow velocities and is based on analysis of temporal changes in the 
      phase of an OCT signal (i.e., how fast the OCT signal rotates in the complex 
      plane). Determination of the rate of phase change or rotation speed critically 
      depends on the center of rotation. Here, we demonstrate the bias in high-pass 
      filtering, the current widely used method to determine the center of rotation, 
      and propose two advanced methods for Doppler OCT clutter rejection. The bias in 
      the high-pass filtering method becomes increasingly significant with lower 
      velocities or larger signal noise. Two novel methods based on variance 
      minimization and offset extrapolation can potentially reduce this bias and 
      thereby improve the accuracy of Doppler OCT measurements of flow velocities, even 
      for low-velocity and/or high-noise signals. The two novel methods and the current 
      standard method (high-pass filtering) have been tested in combination with 
      several currently used velocity measurement algorithms: Kasai, autocorrelation 
      function fitting, and maximum likelihood estimation. The newly proposed methods 
      are shown to improve the accuracy in both the center of rotation and resultant 
      velocity by up to 60 percentage points and reduce the flow conservation error by 
      30% when applied to in vivo cerebral blood flow imaging of the rodent brain 
      cortex.

TI  - The Neurosurgeon's Dilemma-Do Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Medications Increase the 
      Risk of Catheter-Associated Hemorrhage in External Ventricular Drain Placement?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is a common neurosurgical 
      procedure that can be performed at bedside. A frequent complication following EVD 
      placement is catheter-associated hemorrhage (CAH). The hemorrhage itself is 
      rarely clinically significant but may be complicated in patients taking 
      anticoagulant or antiplatelet (AC/AP) medications. METHODS: A total of 757 
      patients were who underwent EVD placement at bedside were included as part of a 
      retrospective study at a large academic medical center. Demographic factors, use 
      of AC/AP therapies, and several other clinical variables were recorded and 
      assessed in univariate and multivariate regression analysis for association with 
      CAH and mortality. RESULTS: One hundred (13.2%) patients experienced CAH within 
      24 hours of the procedure. After univariate analysis, in 2 tandem-run 
      multivariate regression analyses after stepwise variable selection, use of 2 or 
      more AC/AP agents (odds ratio [OR] = 2.362, P = 0.020) and dual antiplatelet 
      therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (OR = 3.72, P = 0.009) were significantly 
      associated with CAH. Use of noncoated catheters was a protective factor against 
      CAH compared to use of antibiotic-coated catheters (OR = 0.55, P = 0.019). 
      Multivariate analysis showed age, multiagent therapy, and thrombocytopenia were 
      significantly associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was 
      increased risk of CAH after EVD placement in patients taking more than one AC/AP 
      agent regardless of presenting pathology. In particular, use of aspirin and 
      clopidogrel combined was associated with significantly higher odds of CAH, 
      although it was not associated with higher mortality. In addition, there appears 
      to be an association between use of antibiotic-coated catheters and CAH across 
      univariate and multivariate analysis.

TI  - Spinal Epidural Hematoma After Attempted Catheter Thrombectomy of a Large 
      Iliofemoral Deep Venous Thrombosis: A Case Report.
PG  - 52-54
AB  - The authors report the case of an 82-year-old woman with a spinal epidural 
      hematoma following attempted catheter-directed thrombolysis of a large femoral- 
      popliteal deep venous thrombosis. The patient rapidly developed acute motor and 
      sensory paralysis below the level of T7 within hours of the thrombectomy 
      procedure. Computed tomography imaging revealed that the catheter had perforated 
      the wall of the right inferior vena cava and magnetic resonance imaging 
      subsequently demonstrated an extensive T1-S1 dorsal epidural hematoma with 
      compression of the thoracic spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina. 
      Given the extent of cord infarction and the risks of extensive thoracolumbar 
      laminectomy, decompression was not performed. The incidence, diagnosis, and 
      management of anticoagulation- associated spinal epidural hematoma as well as the 
      indications for catheter-directed thrombolysis of acute deep venous thrombosis 
      are reviewed.

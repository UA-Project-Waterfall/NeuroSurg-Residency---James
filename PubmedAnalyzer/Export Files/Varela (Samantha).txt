TI  - Corticospinal Motor Circuit Plasticity After Spinal Cord Injury: Harnessing 
      Neuroplasticity to Improve Functional Outcomes.
PG  - 5494-5516

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that affects approximately 
      294,000 people in the USA and several millions worldwide. The corticospinal motor 
      circuitry plays a major role in controlling skilled movements and in planning and 
      coordinating movements in mammals and can be damaged by SCI. While axonal 
      regeneration of injured fibers over long distances is scarce in the adult CNS, 
      substantial spontaneous neural reorganization and plasticity in the spared 
      corticospinal motor circuitry has been shown in experimental SCI models, 
      associated with functional recovery. Beneficially harnessing this neuroplasticity 
      of the corticospinal motor circuitry represents a highly promising therapeutic 
      approach for improving locomotor outcomes after SCI. Several different strategies 
      have been used to date for this purpose including neuromodulation (spinal 
      cord/brain stimulation strategies and brain-machine interfaces), rehabilitative 
      training (targeting activity-dependent plasticity), stem cells and biological 
      scaffolds, neuroregenerative/neuroprotective pharmacotherapies, and light-based 
      therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photobiomodulation (PMBT). This 
      review provides an overview of the spontaneous reorganization and neuroplasticity 
      in the corticospinal motor circuitry after SCI and summarizes the various 
      therapeutic approaches used to beneficially harness this neuroplasticity for 
      functional recovery after SCI in preclinical animal model and clinical human 
      patients' studies.

TI  - Postprocedural Complications of External Ventricular Drains: A Meta-Analysis 
      Evaluating the Absolute Risk of Hemorrhages, Infections, and Revisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD) insertion is often a lifesaving 
      procedure frequently used in neurosurgical emergencies. It is routinely done at 
      the bedside in the neurocritical care unit or in the emergency room. However, 
      there are infectious and noninfectious complications associated with this 
      procedure. This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the absolute risk associated 
      with EVD hemorrhages, infections, and revisions. The secondary purpose was to 
      identify and characterize risk factors for EVD complications. METHODS: We 
      searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) database for "external ventricular drain," 
      "external ventricular drain" + "complications" or "Hemorrhage" or "Infection" or 
      "Revision" irrespective of publication year. Estimates from individual studies 
      were combined using a random effects model, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      were calculated with maximum likelihood specification. To investigate 
      heterogeneity, the t(2) and I(2) tests were utilized. To evaluate for publication 
      bias, a funnel plot was developed. RESULTS: There were 260 total studies screened 
      from our PubMed literature database search, with 176 studies selected for 
      full-text review, and all of these 176 studies were included in the meta-analysis 
      as they met the inclusion criteria. A total of 132,128 EVD insertions were 
      reported, with a total of 130,609 participants having at least one EVD inserted. 
      The pooled absolute risk (risk difference) and percentage of the total 
      variability due to true heterogeneity (I(2)) for hemorrhagic complication was 
      1236/10,203 (risk difference: -0.63; 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.60; I(2): 97.8%), 
      infectious complication was 7278/125,909 (risk difference: -0.65; 95% CI: -0.67 
      to -0.64; I(2): 99.7%), and EVD revision was 674/4416 (risk difference: -0.58; 
      95% CI: -0.65 to -0.51; I(2): 98.5%). On funnel plot analysis, we had a variety 
      of symmetrical plots, and asymmetrical plots, suggesting no bias in larger 
      studies, and the lack of positive effects/methodological quality in smaller 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these findings provide valuable information 
      regarding the safety of one of the most important and most common neurosurgical 
      procedures, EVD insertion. Implementing best-practice standards is recommended in 
      order to reduce EVD-related complications. There is a need for more in-depth 
      research into the independent risk factors associated with these complications, 
      as well as confirmation of these findings by well-structured prospective studies.

TI  - Advanced frailty assessment tool predicts successful awake craniotomy in a 
      92-year-old patient: A case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The awake craniotomy (AC) procedure allows for safe and maximal 
      resection of brain tumors from highly eloquent regions. However, geriatric 
      patients are often viewed as poor candidates for AC due to age and medical 
      comorbidities. Frailty assessments gauge physiological reserve for surgery and 
      are valuable tools for preoperative decision-making. Here, we present a novel 
      case illustrating how frailty scoring enabled an elderly but otherwise healthy 
      female to undergo successful AC for tumor resection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 
      92-year-old right-handed female with history of hypertension and basal cell skin 
      cancer presented with a 1-month history of progressive aphasia and was found to 
      have a ring-enhancing left frontoparietal mass abutting the rolandic cortex 
      concerning for malignant neoplasm. Frailty scoring with the recalibrated risk 
      analysis index (RAI-C) tool revealed a score of 30 (of 81) indicating low 
      surgical risk. The patient and family were counseled appropriately that, despite 
      advanced chronological age, a low frailty score predicts favorable surgical 
      outcomes. The patient underwent left-sided AC for resection of tumor and 
      experienced immediate improvement of speech intraoperatively. After surgery, the 
      patient was neurologically intact and had an unremarkable postoperative course 
      with significant improvements from preoperatively baseline at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the oldest patient 
      to undergo successful AC for brain tumor resection. Nonfrail patients over 90 
      years of age with the proper indications may tolerate cranial surgery. Frailty 
      scoring is a powerful tool for preoperative risk assessment in the geriatric 
      neurosurgery population.

TI  - Continuous Tissue Plasminogen Activator Infusion Using a Minimally Invasive 
      Irrigating Catheter for the Treatment of Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Within the 
      Basal Ganglia: Case Reports.
PG  - e387-e391
LID - 10.1227/ons.0000000000000408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) is a debilitating 
      and highly morbid type of stroke with limited effective treatment modalities. 
      Minimally invasive evacuation with tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has 
      demonstrated promise for mortality/functional improvements with adequate clot 
      volume reduction. In this study, we report 2 cases of continuous rt-PA infusion 
      using a closed circuit, dual lumen catheter, and irrigation system (IRRAflow) for 
      IPH treatment. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old man was admitted for acute 
      onset left hemiparesis; he was found to have right basal ganglia IPH. He was 
      treated with continuous rt-PA irrigation using the IRRAflow device, at a rate of 
      30 mL/h for 119 hours, with a total volume reduction of 87.8 mL and 
      post-treatment volume of 1.2 mL. At 3-month follow-up, he exhibited a modified 
      Rankin score of 4 and improved hemiparesis. A 39-year-old woman was admitted for 
      acute onset left facial droop, left hemianopsia, and left hemiparesis; she was 
      diagnosed with a right basal ganglia IPH. She was treated with drainage and 
      continuous rt-PA irrigation at 30 mL/h for 24 hours, with a total hematoma volume 
      reduction of 41 mL and with a final post-treatment volume of 9.1 mL. At 3-month 
      follow-up, she exhibited a modified Rankin score of 3 with some improvement in 
      left hemiparesis. CONCLUSION: Continuous rt-PA infusion using a minimally 
      invasive catheter with saline irrigation was feasible and resulted in successful 
      volume reduction in 2 patients with IPH. This technique is similar to the 
      Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus rt-PA for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation 
      (MISTIE) approach but offers the potential advantages of less breaks in the 
      sterile circuit, continuous intracranial pressure monitoring, and may provide 
      more efficient clot lysis compared with intermittent bolusing.

TI  - Worse cranial neurosurgical outcomes predicted by increasing frailty in patients 
      with interhospital transfer status: Analysis of 47,736 patients from the National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 2015-2019.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With limited healthcare resources and risks associated with 
      unwarranted interhospital transfers (IHT), it is important to select patients 
      most likely to have improved outcomes with IHT. The present study analyzed the 
      effect of IHT and frailty on postoperative outcomes in a large database of 
      patients who underwent cranial neurosurgical operations. METHODS: The National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for patients 
      who underwent cranial neurosurgical procedures (2015-2019, N = 47,736). Baseline 
      demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome variables were compared 
      between IHT and n-IHT patients. Univariate and multivariable analyses analyzed 
      the effect of IHT status on postoperative outcomes and the utility of frailty 
      (modified frailty index-5 [mFI-5] stratified into "pre-frail, "frail", and 
      "severely frail") as a preoperative risk factor. Effect sizes from regression 
      analyses were presented as odds ratio (OR) with associated 95% confidence 
      intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 47,736 patients with cranial neurosurgical 
      operations, 9612 (20.1%) were IHT. Patients with IHT were older, frailer, with a 
      higher rate of functional dependence. In multivariable analysis adjusted for 
      baseline covariates, IHT status was independent associated with 30-day mortality 
      (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6), major complication (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1), 
      extended hospital length of stay (eLOS) (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 3.6-4.1), and 
      non-routine discharge disposition (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.8-3.2) (all p < 0.05). 
      Within the IHT cohort, increasing frailty ("pre-frail", "frail", "severely 
      frail") was independently associated with increasing odds of 30-day mortality 
      (OR: 1.4, 1.9, 3.9), major complication (OR: 1.4, 1.9, 3.3), unplanned 
      readmission (OR: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1), reoperation (OR: 1.3, 1.5, 1.9), eLOS (OR: 1.2, 
      1.3, 1.5), and non-routine discharge (OR: 1.4, 1.9, 4.4) (all p < 0.05). All 
      levels of frailty were more strongly associated with postoperative outcomes than 
      chronological age. CONCLUSIONS: This novel analysis suggests that patients 
      transferred for cranial neurosurgery operations are significantly more likely to 
      have worse postoperative health outcomes. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that 
      frailty (as measured by mFI-5) is a powerful independent predictor of outcomes in 
      transferred cranial neurosurgery patients. The findings support the use of 
      frailty scoring in the pre-transfer and preoperative setting for patient 
      counseling and risk stratification.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was performed to assess the effect of baseline Preoperative 
      Laboratory Values (PLV) on post-operative Brain Tumor Resection (BTR) outcomes in 
      a large national registry. METHODS: We extracted data from the National Surgical 
      Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database for BTR patients 2015-2019 (n = 3 
      0,951). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed for PLV and key surgical 
      outcomes. RESULTS: The most significant PLV predictors of 30-day mortality after 
      BTR included hypernatremia (odds ratio, OR 4.184, 95% CI, 2.384-7.343, 
      p < 0.001), high serum creatinine (OR 2.244, 95% CI 1.502-3.352, p < 0.001), 
      thrombocytopenia (OR 1.997, 95% CI 1.438, 2.772, p < 0.001), and leukocytosis (OR 
      1.635, 95% CI 1.264, 2.116, p < 0.001). The most significant predictors of 
      Clavien IV complications were increased INR (OR 2.653, 95% CI 1.444, 4.875, 
      p < 0.01), thrombocytopenia (OR 1.514, 95% CI 1.280, 1.792, p < 0.001), 
      hypoalbuminemia (OR 1.480, 95% CI 1.274, 1.719, p < 0.001), and leukocytosis (OR 
      1.467, 95% CI 1.306, 1.647, p < 0.001). The most robust predictors of eLOS were 
      increased INR (OR 1.941, 95% CI 1.231, 3.060, p < 0.01) and hypoalbuminemia (OR 
      1.993, 95% CI 1.823, 2.179, p < 0.001), and those for non-routine discharge 
      included increased INR (OR 1.897, 95% CI 1.196, 3.008, p < 0.01) and 
      hypernatremia (OR 1.565, 95% CI 1.217, 2.012, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Several 
      PLV independently predicted worse outcomes in BTR patients. Baseline labs should 
      be routinely used for the pre-operative risk stratification of these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves patients' quality of life in 
      multiple movement disorders and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. There are no 
      published studies assessing frailty's impact on DBS outcomes. We evaluated 
      frailty's impacts on DBS outcomes, comparing discriminative thresholds of the 
      risk analysis index (RAI) to modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5) for predicting 
      Clavien-Dindo complications (CDIV). METHODS: Patients who underwent DBS between 
      2015 and 2019 in the ACS-NSQIP registry were included. We employed receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve to examine the discriminative thresholds of 
      RAI and mFI-5 and multivariable analyses for postoperative outcomes. Our primary 
      outcome was CDIV, and secondary outcomes were discharge to higher-level care 
      facility, unplanned reoperation within 30 days, in any hospital, for any 
      procedure related to the index procedure, and extended length of stay. RESULTS: A 
      total of 3795 patients were included. In the ROC analysis for CDIV, RAI showed 
      superior discriminative threshold (C-statistic = 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.80, <0.001) 
      than mFI-5 (C-statistic = 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.70, P = 0.08). On multivariable 
      analyses, frailty stratified by RAI, had independent associations with CDIV, 
      i.e., pre-frail 2-fold increase OR 2.04 (95% CI: 1.94-2.14) p < 0.001, and frail 
      39% increase OR 1.39 (95% CI: 1.27-1.53), p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Frailty was an 
      independent risk-factor for CDIV. The RAI had superior discriminative thresholds 
      than mFI-5 in predicting CDIV after DBS. Our ability to identify frail patients 
      prior to DBS presents a novel clinical opportunity for quality improvement 
      strategies to target this specific patient population. RAI may be a useful 
      primary frailty screening modality for potential DBS candidates.

TI  - Superior discrimination of the Risk Analysis Index compared with the 5-item

PG  - 509-519

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to compare the predictive ability of 
      the recalibrated Risk Analysis Index (RAI-rev) with the 5-item modified frailty 
      index-5 (mFI-5) for postoperative outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and 
      fusion (ACDF). METHODS: This study was performed using data of adult (age > 18 
      years) ACDF patients obtained from the National Surgical Quality Improvement 
      Program database during the years 2015-2019. Multivariate modeling and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, including area under the 
      curve/C-statistic calculation with the DeLong test, were performed to evaluate 
      the comparative discriminative ability of the RAI-rev and mFI-5 for 5 
      postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Both the RAI-rev and mFI-5 were independent 
      predictors of increased postoperative mortality and morbidity in a cohort of 
      61,441 ACDF patients. In the ROC analysis for 30-day mortality prediction, 
      C-statistics indicated a significantly better performance of the RAI-rev 
      (C-statistic = 0.855, 95% CI 0.852-0.858) compared with the mFI-5 (C-statistic = 
      0.684, 95% CI 0.680-0.688) (p < 0.001, DeLong test). The results were similar for 
      postoperative ACDF morbidity, Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications, nonhome 
      discharge, and reoperation, demonstrating the superior discriminative ability of 
      the RAI-rev compared with the mFI-5. CONCLUSIONS: The RAI-rev demonstrates 
      superior discrimination to the mFI-5 in predicting postoperative ACDF mortality 
      and morbidity. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to document 
      frailty as an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality after ACDF. The 
      RAI-rev has conceptual fidelity to the frailty phenotype and may be more useful 
      than the mFI-5 in preoperative ACDF risk stratification. Prospective validation 
      of these findings is necessary, but patients with high RAI-rev scores may benefit 
      from knowing that they might have an increased surgical risk for ACDF morbidity 
      and mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frailty's role in preoperative risk assessment in spine surgery has 
      increased in association with the increasing size of the aging population. 
      However, previous frailty assessment tools have significant limitations. The aim 
      of this study was to compare the predictive ability of the Risk Analysis Index 
      (RAI) with the 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5) for postoperative spine 
      surgery morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data were collected from the American 
      College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for 
      adults > 18 years who underwent spine surgery between 2015 and 2019. Multivariate 
      modeling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, including area 
      under the curve/C-statistic calculations, were performed to evaluate the 
      comparative discriminative ability of RAI and mFI-5 on postoperative outcomes. 
      RESULTS: In a cohort of 292,225 spine surgery patients, multivariate modeling 
      showed that increasing RAI scores, and not increasing mFI-5 scores, were 
      independent predictors of increased postoperative mortality for the trauma, 
      tumor, and infection subcohorts. In the overall spine cohort, both increasing RAI 
      and increasing mFI-5 scores were associated with increased mortality, but 
      C-statistics indicated that the RAI (C-statistic 0.802 [95% CI 0.800-0.803], p < 
      0.0001, DeLong test) had superior discrimination compared with the mFI-5 
      (C-statistic 0.677 [95% CI 0.675-0.679], p < 0.0001, DeLong test). In subgroup 
      analyses, the RAI had superior discriminative ability to mFI-5 for mortality in 
      the trauma and infection groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.039, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The RAI demonstrates superior discrimination to the mFI-5 for 
      predicting postoperative mortality and morbidity after spine surgery and the RAI 
      maintains conceptual fidelity to the frailty phenotype. Patients with high RAI 
      scores may benefit from knowing the possibility of increased surgical risk with 
      potential spine surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study sought to evaluate the predictive accuracy of 
      preoperative lab values (PLV) on postoperative metastatic brain tumor resection 
      (MBTR) outcomes using data queried from a large prospective international 
      surgical registry, representing over 700 hospitals in 11 countries. METHODS: 
      Adult metastatic brain tumor patients (N = 5943) were queried from the American 
      College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, 
      from 2015 to 2019, using diagnostic and procedural coding. The relationship 
      between preoperative lab values and key indicators of adverse postoperative 
      outcomes following metastatic brain tumor resection were assessed with univariate 
      and multivariate analyses. Adverse postoperative outcomes of interest included: 
      30-day mortality, Clavien-Dindo Grade IV (CDIV) complications, extended length of 
      stay (eLOS), and discharge to non-home destination (NHD), as well as secondary 
      outcomes: non-Clavien-Dindo Grade IV complications, unplanned reoperation, and 
      unplanned readmission. RESULTS: Independent PLV most strongly associated with 
      30-day mortality were hypernatremia, increased serum creatinine, and 
      thrombocytopenia. Significant predictors of CDIV complications were 
      hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. eLOS was associated with hypoalbuminemia, 
      anemia, and hyponatremia. The strongest independent predictors of NHD were 
      anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSION: Several 
      pre-operative lab values independently predicted worse outcomes for metastatic 
      brain tumor resection patients. Hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia had 
      the strongest association with the study's adverse postoperative outcomes. These 
      baseline lab values may be considered for preoperative risk stratification of 
      metastatic brain tumor patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used a large national database to assess the effect 
      of preoperative laboratory value (PLV) derangements on postoperative outcomes in 
      patients older than 65 years undergoing brain tumor resection. METHODS: Data was 
      collected for patients >65 years old undergoing brain tumor resection from 2015 
      to 2019 (N = 10,525). Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for 11 
      PLVs and 6 postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Hypernatremia (odds ratio [OR], 
      4.707; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.695-13.071; P < 0.01) and increased 
      creatinine level (OR, 2.556; 95% CI, 1.291-5.060; P < 0.01) were the most 
      significant predictors of 30-day mortality. The most significant predictor of 
      Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications was increased creatinine level (OR, 1.667; 
      95% CI, 1.064-2.613; P < 0.05), whereas, significant predictors of major 
      complications were hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.426; 95% CI, 1.132-1.796; P < 0.05) and 
      leukocytosis (OR, 1.347; 95% CI, 1.075-1.688; P < 0.05). Predictors of 
      readmission were anemia (OR, 1.326; 95% CI, 1.047-1.680; P < 0.05) and 
      thrombocytopenia (OR, 1.387; 95% CI, 1.037-1.856; P < 0.05), whereas, 
      hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.787; 95% CI, 1.280-2.495; P < 0.001) was predictive of 
      reoperation. Increased partial thromboplastin time and hypoalbuminemia were 
      predictors of extended length of stay (OR, 2.283, 95% CI, 1.360-3.834, P < 0.01 
      and OR, 1.553, 95% CI, 1.553-1.966, P < 0.001, respectively). Hypernatremia (OR, 
      2.115; 95% CI, 1.181-3.788; P < 0.05) and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.472; 95% CI, 
      1.239-1.748; P < 0.001) were the most significant predictors of NHD. Seven of 11 
      PLVs were associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: PLV 
      derangements were significantly associated with adverse postoperative outcomes in 
      patients older than 65 years undergoing brain tumor resection. The most 
      significant predictors of adverse postoperative outcomes were hypoalbuminemia and 
      leukocytosis.

TI  - The 5-item modified frailty index predicts spinal osteotomy outcomes better than 
      age in adult spinal deformity patients: an ACS - NSQIP analysis.
PG  - 1189-1197
LID - 10.1007/s43390-023-00712-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of 5-Item Modified Frailty Index (mFI-5) as 
      compared to chronological age in predicting outcomes of spinal osteotomy in Adult 
      Spinal Deformity (ASD) patients. METHODS: Using Current Procedural and 
      Terminology (CPT) codes, the American College of Surgeons National Surgery 
      Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for adult patients 
      undergoing spinal osteotomy from 2015 to 2019. Multivariate regression analysis 
      was performed to evaluate the effect of baseline frailty status, measured by 
      mFI-5 score, and chronological age on postoperative outcomes. Receiver-operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to analyze the discriminative 
      performance of age versus mFI-5. RESULTS: A total of 1,789 spinal osteotomy 
      patients (median age 62 years) were included in the analysis. Among the patients 
      assessed, 38.5% (n = 689) were pre-frail, 14.6% frail (n = 262), and 2.2% 
      (n = 39) severely frail using the mFI-5. Based on the multivariate analysis, 
      increasing frailty tier was associated with worsening outcomes, and higher odds 
      ratios (OR) for poor outcomes were found for increasing frailty tiers as compared 
      to age. Severe frailty was associated with the worst outcomes, e.g., unplanned 
      readmission (OR 9.618, [95% CI 4.054-22.818], p < 0.001) and major complications 
      (OR 5.172, [95% CI 2.271-11.783], p < 0.001). In the ROC curve analysis, mFI-5 
      score (AUC 0.838) demonstrated superior discriminative performance than age (AUC 
      0.601) for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The mFI5 frailty score was found to be a 
      better predictor than age of worse postoperative outcomes in ASD patients. 
      Incorporating frailty in preoperative risk stratification is recommended in ASD 
      surgery.

TI  - The risk analysis index demonstrates superior discriminative ability in 
      predicting extended length of stay in pituitary adenoma resection patients when 
      compared to the 5-point modified frailty index.
PG  - 100259

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive abilities of two frailty indices on 
      post-operative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing pituitary adenoma 
      resection. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 
      database was used to retrospectively collect data for patients undergoing 
      pituitary adenoma resection between 2015-2019. To compare the predictive 
      abilities of two of the most common frailty indices, the 5-point modified frailty 
      index (mFI-5) and the risk analysis index (RAI), receiver operating curve 
      analysis (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC)/Cstatistic were used. RESULTS: In 
      our cohort of 1,454 patients, the RAI demonstrated superior discriminative 
      ability to the mFI-5 in predicting extended length of stay (C-statistic 0.59, 95% 
      CI 0.56-0.62 vs. C-statistic 0.51, 95% CI: 0.48-0.54, p = 0.0002). The RAI only 
      descriptively appeared superior to mFI-5 in determining mortality (C-statistic 
      0.89, 95% CI 0.74-0.99 vs. Cstatistic 0.63, 95% CI 0.61-0.66, p=0.11), and NHD 
      (C-statistic 0.68, 95% CI 0.60-0.76 vs. C-statistic 0.60, 95% CI: 
      0.57-0.62, p=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Pituitary adenomas account for one of the most 
      common brain tumors in the general population, with resection being the preferred 
      treatment for patients with most hormone producing tumors or those causing 
      compressive symptoms. Although pituitary adenoma resection is generally safe, 
      patients who experience post-operative complications frequently share similar 
      pre-operative characteristics and comorbidities. Therefore, appropriate 
      pre-operative risk stratification is imperative for adequate patient counseling 
      and informed consent in these patients. Here we present the first known report 
      showing the superior discriminatory ability of the RAI in predicting eLOS when 
      compared to the mFI-5.

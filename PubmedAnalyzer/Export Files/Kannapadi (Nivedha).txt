AB  - IMPORTANCE: Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that persist or develop 
      three months after the onset of COVID-19 pose a significant threat to the global 
      healthcare system. These symptoms are yet to be synthesized and quantified via 
      meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of neurological and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms reported 12 weeks (3 months) or more after acute 
      COVID-19 onset in adults. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted for studies published 
      between January 1st, 2020 and August 1st, 2021. The systematic review was guided 
      by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Studies were included if the length of follow-up satisfied the 
      National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of post-COVID-19 
      syndrome (symptoms that develop or persist ≥3 months after the onset of 
      COVID-19). Additional criteria included the reporting of neurological or 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently extracted data on patient characteristics, 
      hospital and/or ICU admission, acute-phase COVID-19 symptoms, length of 
      follow-up, and neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND 
      MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was the prevalence of neurological and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms reported ≥3 months post onset of COVID-19. We also 
      compared post-COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalised vs. non-hospitalised patients, 
      with vs. without ICU admission during the acute phase of infection, and with 
      mid-term (3 to 6 months) and long-term (>6 months) follow-up. RESULTS: Of 1458 
      articles, 19 studies, encompassing a total of 11,324 patients, were analysed. 
      Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 
      95% CI: 24%-50%), brain fog (32%, 9%-55%), memory issues (27%, 18%-36%), 
      attention disorder (22%, 10%-34%), myalgia (18%, 4%-32%), anosmia (12%, 7%-17%), 
      dysgeusia (11%, 4%-17%) and headache (10%, 1%-21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions 
      included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%-43%), anxiety (23%, 13%-33%) and depression 
      (12%, 7%-21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence 
      between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, 
      patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced frequency of anosmia, 
      anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance 
      at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was 
      associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.3). 
      Cohorts with >20% of patients admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 
      experienced higher prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep 
      disturbances than cohorts with <20% of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory issues, attention disorder) and 
      sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID-19 syndrome. 
      Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) are 
      common and increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled 
      trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.

TI  - Synthesizing Molecular and Immune Characteristics to Move Beyond WHO Grade in 
      Meningiomas: A Focused Review.
PG  - 892004
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.892004 [doi]

AB  - No portion of this manuscript has previously been presented. Meningiomas, the 
      most common primary intracranial tumors, are histologically categorized by the 
      World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. While higher WHO grade is 
      generally associated with poor clinical outcomes, a significant subset of grade I 
      tumors recur or progress, indicating a need for more reliable models of 
      meningioma behavior. Several groups have developed risk scores based on molecular 
      or immunologic characteristics. These classification schemes show promise, with 
      several models preliminarily demonstrating similar or superior accuracy to WHO 
      grading. Improved understanding of immune system recognition and targeting of 
      meningioma subtypes is necessary to advance the predictive power, as well as 
      develop new therapies. Here, we characterize meningioma molecular drivers, 
      predictive of recurrence and progression, and describe specific aspects of the 
      immune response to meningiomas while highlighting critical questions and ongoing 
      research. Relevant manuscripts of interest were identified using a systematic 
      approach and synthesized into this focused review. Finally, we summarize the 
      ongoing and completed clinical trials for immunotherapy in meningiomas and offer 
      perspective on future directions.

AB  - Acute cerebral ischemia triggers a profound inflammatory response. While 
      macrophages polarized to an M2-like phenotype clear debris and facilitate tissue 
      repair, aberrant or prolonged macrophage activation is counterproductive to 
      recovery. The inhibitory immune checkpoint Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) 
      is upregulated on macrophage precursors (monocytes) in the blood after acute 
      cerebrovascular injury. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PD-1 
      activation, we immunophenotyped circulating monocytes from patients and found 
      that PD-1 expression was upregulated in the acute period after stroke. Murine 
      studies using a temporary middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) model 
      showed that intraperitoneal administration of soluble Programmed Death Ligand-1 
      (sPD-L1) significantly decreased brain edema and improved overall survival. Mice 
      receiving sPD-L1 also had higher performance scores short-term, and more closely 
      resembled sham animals on assessments of long-term functional recovery. These 
      clinical and radiographic benefits were abrogated in global and myeloid-specific 
      PD-1 knockout animals, confirming PD-1+ monocytes as the therapeutic target of 
      sPD-L1. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that treatment skewed monocyte 
      maturation to a non-classical Ly6C(lo), CD43(hi), PD-L1+ phenotype. These data 
      support peripheral activation of PD-1 on inflammatory monocytes as a therapeutic 
      strategy to treat neuroinflammation after acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - Internal neurolysis versus intraoperative glycerin rhizotomy for trigeminal 
      neuralgia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internal neurolysis (IN) and intraoperative glycerin rhizotomy (ioGR) 
      are emerging surgical options for patients with trigeminal neuralgia without 
      neurovascular contact. The objective of this study was to compare the 
      neurological outcomes of patients who underwent IN with those of patients who 
      underwent ioGR. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients who 
      underwent IN or ioGR for trigeminal neuralgia at our institution. Patient 
      demographic characteristics and immediate postoperative outcomes, as well as 
      long-term neurological outcomes, were compared. RESULTS: Of 1044 patients who 
      underwent open surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, 56 patients underwent 
      IN and 91 underwent ioGR. Of these 147 patients, 37 had no evidence of 
      intraoperative neurovascular conflict. All patients who underwent IN and 96.7% of 
      patients who underwent ioGR had immediate postoperative pain relief. At last 
      follow-up, patients who underwent IN had lower Barrow Neurological Institute 
      (BNI) pain intensity scores (p = 0.05), better BNI facial numbness scores (p < 
      0.01), and a greater degree of pain improvement (p = 0.05) compared with those 
      who underwent ioGR. Patients who underwent IN also had significantly lower rates 
      of symptomatic pain recurrence (p < 0.01) at last follow-up over an average of 
      9.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: IN appears to provide patients with a greater degree of 
      pain relief, lower rates of facial numbness, and lower rates of pain recurrence 
      compared with ioGR. Future prospective studies will better characterize long-term 
      pain recurrence and outcomes.

TI  - Reexamining the Role of Postoperative ICU Admission for Patients Undergoing 
      Elective Craniotomy: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1380-1393
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000005588 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The standard-of-care for postoperative care following elective 
      craniotomy has historically been ICU admission. However, recent literature 
      interrogating complications and interventions during this postoperative ICU stay 
      suggests that all patients may not require this level of care. Thus, hospitals 
      began implementing non-ICU postoperative care pathways for elective craniotomy. 
      This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate the existing literature 
      regarding outcomes and costs for patients receiving non-ICU care after elective 
      craniotomy. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the PubMed database was 
      performed following PRISMA guidelines from database inception to August 2021. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Included studies were published in peer-reviewed journals, in 
      English, and described outcomes for patients undergoing elective craniotomies 
      without postoperative ICU care. DATA EXTRACTION: Data regarding study design, 
      patient characteristics, and postoperative care pathways were extracted 
      independently by two authors. Quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the 
      Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence tool and Risk Of 
      Bias In Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions tool, respectively. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: In total, 1,131 unique articles were identified through the database 
      search, with 27 meeting inclusion criteria. Included articles were published from 
      2001 to 2021 and included non-ICU inpatient care and same-day discharge pathways. 
      Overall, the studies demonstrated that postoperative non-ICU care for elective 
      craniotomies led to length of stay reduction ranging from 6 hours to 4 days and 
      notable cost reductions. Across 13 studies, 53 of the 2,469 patients (2.1%) 
      intended for postoperative management in a non-ICU setting required subsequent 
      care escalation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these studies suggest that non-ICU care 
      pathways for appropriately selected postcraniotomy patients may represent a 
      meaningful opportunity to improve care value. However, included studies varied 
      greatly in patient selection, postoperative care protocol, and outcomes 
      reporting. Standardization and multi-institutional collaboration are needed to 
      draw definitive conclusions regarding non-ICU postoperative care for elective 
      craniotomy.

TI  - Duration of Hyperoxia and Neurologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing

PG  - e968-e977
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000005069 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of duration of hyperoxia on neurologic outcome 
      and mortality in patients undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of venoarterial extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The primary 
      outcome was neurologic function at discharge defined by modified Rankin Scale, 
      with a score of 0-3 defined as a good neurologic outcome, and a score of 4-6 
      defined as a poor neurologic outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
      was performed to evaluate the association between hyperoxia and neurologic 
      outcomes. SETTING: The Johns Hopkins Hospital Cardiovascular ICU and Cardiac 
      Critical Care Unit. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We 
      measured first and maximum Pao2 values, area under the curve per minute over the 
      first 24 hours, and duration of mild, moderate, and severe hyperoxia. Of 132 
      patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 127 (96.5%) were 
      exposed to mild hyperoxia in the first 24 hours. Poor neurologic outcomes were 
      observed in 105 patients (79.6%) (102 with vs 3 without hyperoxia; p = 0.14). 
      Patients with poor neurologic outcomes had longer exposure to mild (19.1 vs 
      15.2 hr; p = 0.01), moderate (14.6 vs 9.2 hr; p = 0.003), and severe hyperoxia 
      (9.1 vs 4.0 hr; p = 0.003). In a multivariable analysis, patients with worse 
      neurologic outcome experienced longer durations of mild (adjusted odds ratio, 
      1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19; p = 0.02), moderate (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 
      1.04-1.22; p = 0.002), and severe (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.35; 
      p = 0.003) hyperoxia. Additionally, duration of severe hyperoxia was 
      independently associated with inhospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 
      95% CI, 1.08-1.29; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing venoarterial 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, duration and severity of early hyperoxia 
      were independently associated with poor neurologic outcomes at discharge and 
      mortality.

TI  - Preclinical efficacy of ribavirin in SHH and group 3 medulloblastoma.
PG  - 482-488
LID - 10.3171/2020.8.PEDS20561 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain malignancy, has Sonic 
      Hedgehog (SHH) and group 3 (Myc driven) subtypes that are associated with the 
      activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a critical mediator of 
      translation, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase 
      and master regulator of transcription. Recent drug repurposing efforts in 
      multiple solid and hematologic malignancies have demonstrated that eIF4E and EZH2 
      are both pharmacologically inhibited by the FDA-approved antiviral drug 
      ribavirin. Given the molecular overlap between medulloblastoma biology and known 
      ribavirin activity, the authors investigated the preclinical efficacy of 
      repurposing ribavirin as a targeted therapeutic in cell and animal models of 
      medulloblastoma. METHODS: Multiple in vitro assays were performed using human 
      ONS-76 (a primitive SHH model) and D425 (an aggressive group 3 model) cells. The 
      impacts of ribavirin on cellular growth, death, migration, and invasion were 
      quantified using proliferation and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, flow 
      cytometry with annexin V (AnnV) staining, scratch wound assays, and Matrigel 
      invasion chambers, respectively. Survival following daily ribavirin treatment 
      (100 mg/kg) was assessed in vivo in immunodeficient mice intracranially implanted 
      with D425 cells. RESULTS: Compared to controls, ribavirin treatment led to a 
      significant reduction in medulloblastoma cell growth (ONS-76 proliferation assay, 
      p = 0.0001; D425 CCK-8 assay, p < 0.0001) and a significant increase in cell 
      death (flow cytometry for AnnV, ONS-76, p = 0.0010; D425, p = 0.0284). In ONS-76 
      cells, compared to controls, ribavirin significantly decreased cell migration and 
      invasion (Matrigel invasion chamber assay, p = 0.0012). In vivo, ribavirin 
      significantly extended survival in an aggressive group 3 medulloblastoma mouse 
      model compared to vehicle-treated controls (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The authors 
      demonstrate that ribavirin, a clinically used drug known to inhibit eIF4E and 
      EZH2, has significant antitumor effects in multiple preclinical models of 
      medulloblastoma, including an aggressive group 3 animal model. Ribavirin may 
      represent a promising targeted therapeutic in medulloblastoma.

TI  - Case Series in the Utility of Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring in Microvascular 
      Decompression.
PG  - 262-268
LID - 10.1227/ons.0000000000000130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of arterial lines in microvascular decompression (MVD) is 
      not well described. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and costs of arterial lines 
      compared with noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring in MVDs. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing MVD from 2012 to 2020. Patients were 
      grouped by procedure date from 2012 to 2014 and 2015 to 2020, reflecting our 
      institution's decreasing trend in arterial line placement around 2014 to 2015. 
      Patient features, intraoperative characteristics, and postoperative complications 
      were collected for all cases. Statistical differences were evaluated using 
      chi-squared analyses and t-tests. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifty-eight patients 
      underwent MVDs, with 204 between 2012 and 2014 and 654 between 2015 and 2020. 
      Over time, the frequency of arterial line placement decreased from 64.2% to 
      30.1%, P < .001. Arterial lines involved 11 additional minutes of preincision 
      time, P < .001. Patients with arterial lines required both increased doses and 
      costs of vasoactive medications intraoperatively. Patients receiving arterial 
      lines demonstrated no significant differences in complications compared with 
      patients with NIBP monitoring. On average, patients with arterial lines incurred 
      $802 increased costs per case compared with NIBP monitoring. CONCLUSION: NIBP 
      monitoring in MVDs provides neurologically and hemodynamically safe outcomes 
      compared with invasive blood pressure monitoring. For patients without 
      significant cardiopulmonary risk factors, NIBP monitoring may be a cost-effective 
      alternative in MVDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute 
      respiratory disease (ARDS) increasingly receive extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation (ECMO) support. While ECMO has been shown to increase risk of stroke, 
      few studies have examined this association in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: We 
      conducted a systematic review to characterise neurological events during ECMO 
      support in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Systematic review of cohort and large case 
      series of COVID-19 patients who received ECMO support. DATA SOURCES: Studies 
      retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of 
      Science, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and medRχiv from inception to November 
      11, 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were a) Adult population (>18 
      year old); b) Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 with active COVID-19 disease; c) 
      ECMO therapy due to COVID-19 ARDS; and d) Neurological events and outcome 
      described while on ECMO support. We excluded articles when no details of 
      neurologic events were available. RESULTS: 1,322 patients from 12 case series and 
      retrospective cohort studies were included in our study. The median age was 49.2, 
      and 75% (n=985) of the patients were male. Diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia 
      were the most common comorbidities (24% and 20%, respectively). Most (95%, 
      n=1,241) patients were on venovenous ECMO with a median P:F ratio at the time of 
      ECMO cannulation of 69.1. The prevalence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), 
      ischaemic stroke, and hypoxic ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) was 5.9% (n=78), 1.1% 
      (n=15), and 0.3% (n=4), respectively. The overall mortality of the 1,296 ECMO 
      patients in the 10 studies that reported death was 36% (n=477), and the mortality 
      of the subset of patients who had a neurological event was 92%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neurological injury is a concern for COVID-19 patients who receive ECMO. Further 
      research is required to explore how neuromonitoring protocols can inform tailored 
      anticoagulation management and improve survival in COVID-19 patients with ECMO 
      support.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Effective therapies for acute pain management in trigeminal neuralgia 
      (TN) are limited. We aimed to investigate the role of steroids in TN patients 
      experiencing acute pain flares. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients 
      presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary care institution between 
      2014 and 2020 for acute TN pain flares. Patients were divided into those who 
      received steroids versus those who did not. Presenting characteristics, admission 
      and surgical intervention rates, Barrow Neurological Institute pain scores, pain 
      recurrence rates, and surgical intervention within 6 months of discharge were 
      obtained for each patient. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 151 patients, of whom 40 
      (26.5%) received steroids before admission and/or discharge. These patients were 
      less likely to undergo surgical intervention to treat acute pain (P = 0.023). 
      Specifically, patients receiving steroids were less likely to undergo combined 
      glycerin and radiofrequency rhizotomy compared with patients not receiving 
      steroids (P = 0.012). Frequency and dosage of opioid administration did not 
      differ between groups. The steroids group demonstrated a lower average Barrow 
      Neurological Institute pain score on discharge compared with the no steroids 
      group (P = 0.013). Patients receiving steroids for acute pain management were 
      less likely to undergo surgical intervention within 6 months of discharge than 
      patients who did not receive steroids (P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Steroid 
      administration in patients with acute TN pain flares may reduce the likelihood of 
      surgical intervention both during admission and within 6 months of discharge. 
      Future prospective studies should examine the efficacy of steroids as an 
      adjunctive medication in acute TN pain management.

AB  - Acute brain injury (ABI) and neuroinflammation is reported in COVID-19 and acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It remains unclear if COVID-19 plays an 
      independent role in development of ABI compared to those with non-COVID-19 ARDS. 
      We aimed to evaluate if COVID-19 ARDS is associated with higher risk and specific 
      patterns of ABI compared to non-COVID-19 ARDS. We conducted an age and sex 
      matched case-control autopsy study at a tertiary academic center. Ten patients 
      with COVID-19 ARDS were matched to 20 non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. Baseline 
      demographics were comparable between the two groups including severity of ARDS (p 
      = 0.3). The frequency of overall ABI (70 vs. 60%), infratentorial ABI (40 vs. 
      25%), ischemic infarct (40 vs. 25%), intracranial hemorrhage (30 vs. 35%), and 
      hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (30 vs. 35%) was similar between COVID-19 and 
      non-COVID-19 ARDS patients, respectively (p > 0.05). Intracapillary 
      megakaryocytes were exclusively seen in 30% of COVID-19 patients. Overall, 
      frequency and pattern of ABI in COVID-19 ARDS was comparable to non-COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the common occurrence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
      (ECMO)-associated acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), 
      there are little data to guide optimal anticoagulation management. We sought to 
      describe antithrombotic therapy management after stroke and outcomes. METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was conducted of venoarterial (VA) and venovenous (VV) 
      ECMO patients treated at a tertiary care center from June 2016 to February 2021. 
      Patients with image-confirmed diagnosis of AIS or ICH while receiving ECMO were 
      included for study with data collected regarding anticoagulation management and 
      clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 216 patients (153 VA-ECMO, 63 VV-ECMO) were 
      included in this study. Of the 153 patients on VA-ECMO, 13 (8.4%) had AIS and 6 
      (3.9%) had ICH. Of the 63 patients on VV-ECMO, none had AIS and 5 (7.9%) had ICH. 
      One patient (9%) received anticoagulation reversal after ICH. Anticoagulation was 
      discontinued and later resumed in all 5 ICH survivors (median cessation time, 30 
      h) and 1 of 2 (50%) AIS survivors (median cessation time, 96 h). While off 
      anticoagulation, 2 of 11 patients (18%) had thromboembolic events and none had 
      new AIS. Upon resumption, there were no cases of hemorrhagic transformation of 
      AIS or ICH expansion. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between 
      patients with ICH and those without in both the VA-ECMO and VV-ECMO cohorts nor 
      between VA-ECMO patients with AIS and those without. CONCLUSIONS: Early cessation 
      and judicious resumption of anticoagulation appeared feasible in the cohort of 
      patients with ECMO-associated AIS and ICH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic syringomyelia is an uncommon complication after 
      traumatic spinal cord injury. This case study details our decision-making and 
      surgical approach for a patient with symptomatic post-traumatic syringomyelia 
      after sustaining a gunshot wound. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man with past 
      medical history of distant American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Grade B 
      spinal cord injury due to ballistic injury developed delayed post-traumatic 
      syringomyelia, resulting in unilateral sensory loss and left upper extremity 
      weakness. CT and MR imaging revealed a syrinx spanning his cervical and thoracic 
      spine causing significant spinal cord compression. To relieve achieve 
      decompression and restore CSF flow dynamics, we performed a bony extradural 
      decompression, bullet fragment extraction, spinal cord untethering, and midline 
      myelotomy. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated clinical and radiographical 
      improvement. DISCUSSION: Post-traumatic syringomyelia is potentially morbid 
      sequalae of spinal cord injuries. Suspicion for post-traumatic syringomyelia 
      should be maintained in patients with delayed, progressive neurologic deficits. 
      In this setting, surgical intervention may require extradural and intradural 
      procedures to mitigate neural compression along the dilated central canal by the 
      syrinx.

PG  - 917-922

AB  - Current studies underestimate the prevalence of brain injury in patients with 
      left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), as CT scans are not sensitive in 
      detecting cerebral ischemia. Using postmortem neuropathological evaluation, we 
      sought to characterize the types and risk factors of brain injury in LVAD 
      patients. We reviewed 24 LVAD patients who underwent brain autopsy with gross and 
      microscopic examinations from 1993 through 2019 at a single tertiary center. 
      Patients who expired less than 7 days after implantation or who underwent 
      explantation more than 7 days before death were excluded. Our study demonstrated 
      that all LVAD nonsurvivors developed brain injury. The most common brain injury 
      was hemorrhage (71%), followed by infarct (42%) and hypoxic ischemic brain injury 
      (HIBI) (33%), and 10 patients (42%) presented with more than 1 brain injury. 
      Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and intracranial hemorrhage were present in 33% and 
      42%, respectively. In those with intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage 
      (25%) and intracerebral hemorrhage (25%) were more common than subdural hematoma 
      (4%). Intracranial hemorrhage was associated with driveline infection (P = 
      0.047), and HIBI was associated with prior history of chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (P = 0.037). Fourteen (60%) had clinically silent brain injury 
      with 65% of hemorrhages and 70% of infarcts being silent. However, the impact of 
      silent brain injury on neurologic outcome and mortality remains unclear. 
      Standardized neurologic monitoring and surveillance are recommended to better 
      detect these clinically silent brain injury.

AB  - Determinants of tuberculosis (TB) syringomyelia, its management options and 
      outcomes are still under investigation. The aim of this study is to present a 
      case of TB syringomyelia with markedly improved symptoms status-post surgery and 
      to understand the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 33 TB syringomyelia 
      cases reported in the literature. Specifically, we examined the differences 
      between patients who were managed medically and those who underwent surgical 
      intervention. Inclusion criteria for the cases were (1) syringomyelia caused by 
      TB infection rather than co-occurrence of these conditions, (2) management 
      protocol described, and (3) post-treatment outcome described. The median age was 
      30 years (interquartile range (IQR): 23-40) with 55% males. The median time 
      between TB onset to syringomyelia diagnosis was 2 years. Nineteen patients were 
      surgically treated, 11 were medically treated, and 3 received no treatment. 
      Twenty-one patients showed improvement in at least one prior symptom, but no 
      patient experienced a full recovery. Those that underwent surgical intervention 
      were more likely to have TB meningitis (95% vs. 64%, p < 0.05) upon initial TB 
      presentation and have a greater interval between TB onset and syringomyelia 
      presentation (median of 2.6 vs. 0.33 years, ns). A greater proportion of the 
      surgically managed patients experienced improvement in any symptom (74% vs. 45%, 
      ns). Future case-controlled studies with larger sample sizes are required to 
      validate and further understand the outcomes of surgically-managed TB 
      syringomyelia.

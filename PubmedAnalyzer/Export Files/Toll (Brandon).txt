TI  - Opioid-induced toxic leukoencephalopathy: A case report and review of the 
      literature.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy (TLE) due to opioids have been 
      extensively documented within the adult literature. There is a paucity of 
      literature with respect to the incidence, complications, and outcomes of TLE in 
      the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare complication of opioid 
      ingestion in the pediatric population and serve as the first large review of 
      published cases of opioid-induced leukoencephalopathy. Thirteen case reports with 
      varying treatments are herein reviewed in addition to our own case. The range of 
      treatment modalities, morbidity and mortality are broad and outcomes secondary to 
      supportive care versus neurosurgical intervention is explored. EVIDENCE REVIEW: 
      All cases of pediatric opioid-induced toxic leukoencephalopathy published on 
      pubmed and google scholar were included in this review. FINDINGS: We report the 
      case of a 4-year old male surgically treated for acute oxycodone-induced TLE who 
      initially presented with Glascow Coma Scale of 4 and a comatose state for weeks. 
      Over the next several months he recovered with spasticity of all extremities, 
      oral aversion, substantial vision loss, and the ability to speak in short 
      sentences. In addition, we found thirteen other reported cases of opioid-induced 
      leukoencephalopathy reported in the literature. The treatment approaches 
      described range from supportive care alone, to invasive neurosurgical 
      interventions including placement of extraventricular drains, removal of 
      hemorrhagic tissue, and craniectomy. The outcomes of patients with opioid-induced 
      leukoencephalopathy is also variable. Reports demonstrate a range of outcomes 
      that include patients who died to those with no residual neurologic deficits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review of reported pediatric cases of opioid-induced 
      leukoencephalopathy highlights the importance of early neurosurgical intervention 
      for prevention of devastating outcomes.

TI  - Risk factors for proximal junctional kyphosis after pediatric spinal deformity 
      surgery with halo gravity traction.
PG  - 1913-1922
LID - 10.1007/s00381-022-05596-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine risk factors for proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in 
      pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing halo gravity traction (HGT) prior to 
      posterior spinal fusion (PSF). METHODS: Data from consecutive patients who 
      underwent PSF after HGT with 2-year follow-up were retrospectively collected from 
      a single center. Patients were divided into two groups: PJK vs. no PJK. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five patients (age 13.6 ± 3.1 years) underwent HGT for a mean of 
      42 ± 37 days. Eight patients (32%) developed radiographic PJK and 1 (4%) 
      developed proximal junctional failure. PJK patients had greater loss of cervical 
      lordosis (-17.4 ± 23.2 vs. 2.7 ± 16.2°, p < 0.05), greater increase in lumbar 
      lordosis (9.3 ± 19.5 vs. -2.8 ± 12.8°; p = 0.034) during traction, and smaller 
      overall major coronal curve angle correction (-16.8 ± 30.6 vs. -36.6 ± 16.4°; 
      p = 0.026). From postoperative to last follow-up, PJK patients had a greater 
      increase in upper end vertebrae (UEV) slope (3.3 ± 7.8 vs. -4.0 ± 7.7°; 
      p = 0.004). Selection of UIV based on which vertebra was most level either 
      pre-traction or in-traction was not associated with PJK development (p > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: In-traction radiographic changes of decreased cervical lordosis, 
      decreased major coronal curve, increased lumbar lordosis, and disruption of 
      cervical sagittal balance at last follow-up may have implications for level 
      selection and risk of PJK.

TI  - Congenital Scoliosis of the Pediatric Cervical Spine: Characterization of a 
      17-Patient Operative Cohort.
PG  - e211-e216
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000001718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital cervical scoliosis is rare, and there is a paucity of 
      literature describing surgical outcomes. We report surgical outcomes in a 
      17-patient cohort with surgical correction for congenital cervical scoliosis and 
      identify risk factors associated with complications. METHODS: Data were 
      retrospectively collected from a single-center cohort of 17 consecutive patients 
      (9 boys, 8 girls) receiving surgical deformity correction for congenital cervical 
      scoliosis. The mean age at surgery was 7.1±3.4 years with an average follow-up of 
      3.6±1.1 years. RESULTS: There were 24 operations performed on 17 patients, and 4 
      complications (17%) were reported in the series, including one each of pressure 
      ulcer, asystole, vertebral artery injury, and pseudarthrosis. The mean 
      preoperative major curve angle was 36±20 degrees, which improved to 24±14 degrees 
      (P=0.02). The mean operative time was 8±2 hours with a mean estimated blood loss 
      of 298±690 mL. Halo-gravity traction was used in 5 patients and 6 cases were 
      staged with anterior/posterior procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital scoliosis of 
      the cervical spine is a complex process. The spinal deformity of this nature can 
      be managed successfully with carefully planned and executed surgical correction. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-retrospective review.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence and 
      risk factors for postoperative pain following anterior vertebral body tethering 
      (AVBT) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Up 
      to 78% of patients with AIS report preoperative pain; it is the greatest patient 
      concern surrounding surgery. Pain significantly decreases following posterior 
      spinal fusion, but pain following AVBT is poorly understood. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 279 patients with a two-year follow-up after 
      AVBT for AIS. We collected demographic, radiographic, and clinical data pertinent 
      to postoperative pain at each time interval of preoperative and postoperative 
      visits (6 wk, 6 mo, 1 y, and annually thereafter). RESULTS: Within our cohort, 
      68.1% of patients reported preoperative pain. Older age ( P =0.014) and greater 
      proximal thoracic ( P =0.013) and main thoracic ( P =0.002) coronal curve 
      magnitudes were associated with preoperative pain. Pain at any time point > 6 
      weeks postoperatively was reported in 41.6% of patients; it was associated with 
      the female sex ( P =0.032), need for revision surgery ( P =0.019), and greater 
      lateral displacement of the apical lumbar vertebrae ( P =0.028). The association 
      between preoperative and postoperative pain trended toward significance ( P 
      =0.07). At 6 months postoperatively, 91.8% had pain resolution; the same number 
      remained pain-free at the time of last follow-up. The presence of a postoperative 
      complication was associated with new-onset postoperative pain that resolved ( P 
      =0.009). Only 8.2% had persistent pain, although no risk factors were found to be 
      associated with persistent pain. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of 279 patients with a 
      minimum 2-year follow-up after AVBT, 68.1% reported preoperative pain. Nearly 42% 
      reported postoperative pain at any time point, but only 8.2% had persistent pain. 
      Postoperative pain after AVBT was associated with female sex, revision surgery, 
      and Lenke lumbar modifier. AVBT is associated with a significant reduction in 
      pain, and few patients report long-term postoperative pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE High rates of perioperative complications are associated with deformity 
      correction in neuromuscular scoliosis. The current study aimed to evaluate 
      complications associated with surgical correction of neuromuscular scoliosis and 
      to characterize potential risk factors. METHODS Data were retrospectively 
      collected from a single-center cohort of 102 consecutive patients who underwent 
      spinal fusions for neuromuscular scoliosis between January 2008 and December 2016 
      and who had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. A subgroup analysis was performed 
      on data from patients who had at least 2 years of follow-up. Univariate and 
      multivariate regression analyses, as well as binary correlational models and 
      Student t-tests, were employed for further statistical analysis. RESULTS The 
      present cohort had 53 boys and 49 girls with a mean age at surgery of 14.0 years 
      (± 2.7 SD, range 7.5-19.5 years). The most prevalent diagnoses were cerebral 
      palsy (26.5%), spinal cord injury (24.5%), and neurofibromatosis (10.8%). 
      Analysis reflected an overall perioperative complication rate of 27% (37 
      complications in 27 patients), 81.1% of which constituted major complications (n 
      = 30) compared to a rate of 18.9% for minor complications (n = 7). Complications 
      were predicted by nonambulatory status (p = 0.037), increased intraoperative 
      blood loss (p = 0.012), increased intraoperative time (p = 0.046), greater pelvic 
      obliquity at follow-up (p = 0.028), and greater magnitude of sagittal profile at 
      follow-up (p = 0.048). Pulmonary comorbidity (p = 0.001), previous operations (p 
      = 0.013), history of seizures (p = 0.046), diagnosis of myelomeningocele (p = 
      0.046), increase in weight postoperatively (p < 0.005), and increased lumbar 
      lordosis at follow-up (p = 0.015) were identified as risk factors for 
      perioperative infection. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that in neuromuscular 
      scoliosis, patients with preexisting pulmonary compromise and greater 
      intraoperative blood loss have the greatest risk of experiencing a major 
      perioperative complication following surgical deformity correction.

TI  - Risk Factors for Proximal Junctional Kyphosis Following Surgical Deformity 
      Correction in Pediatric Neuromuscular Scoliosis.
PG  - 169-174

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate risk factors associated with the development of 
      proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in pediatric neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS). 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PJK is a common cause of reoperation in adult 
      deformity but has been less well reported in pediatric NMS. METHODS: Sixty 
      consecutive pediatric patients underwent spinal fusion for NMS with a minimum 
      2-year follow-up. PJK was defined as >10° increase between the inferior end plate 
      of the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and the superior end plate of the 
      vertebra two segments above. Regression analyses as well as binary correlational 
      models and Student t tests were employed for further statistical analysis 
      assessing variables of primary and compensatory curve magnitudes, thoracic 
      kyphosis, proximal kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic obliquity, shoulder 
      imbalance, Risser classification, and sagittal profile. RESULTS: The present 
      cohort consisted of 29 boys and 31 girls with a mean age at surgery of 14 ± 2.7 
      years. The most prevalent diagnoses were spinal cord injury (23%) and cerebral 
      palsy (20%). Analysis reflected an overall radiographic PJK rate of 27% (n = 16) 
      and a proximal junctional failure rate of 7% (n = 4). No significant association 
      was identified with previously suggested risk factors such as extent of rostral 
      fixation (P = 0.750), rod metal type (P = 0.776), laminar hooks (P = 0.654), 
      implant density (P = 0.386), nonambulatory functional status (P = 0.254), or 
      pelvic fixation (P = 0.746). Significant risk factors for development of PJK 
      included perioperative use of halo gravity traction (38%, P = 0.029), greater 
      postoperative C2 sagittal translation (P = 0.030), decreased proximal kyphosis 
      preoperatively (P = 0.002), and loss of correction of primary curve magnitude at 
      follow-up (P = 0.047). Increase in lumbar lordosis from post-op to last follow-up 
      trended toward significance (P = 0.055). CONCLUSION: Twenty-seven percent of 
      patients with NMS developed PJK, and 7% had revision surgery. Those treated with 
      halo gravity traction or with greater postoperative C2 sagittal translation, loss 
      of primary curve correction, and smaller preoperative proximal kyphosis had the 
      greatest risk of developing PJK.Level of Evidence: 4.

TI  - Do drains help reduce the risk of complications after thoracoplasties in 
      posterior spinal fusions for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?
PG  - 557-564
LID - 10.1007/s00381-021-05421-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the rib prominence is a major 
      cosmetic concern which can be improved using thoracoplasties. We sought to 
      determine if the use of deep drains helps minimize the development of pleural 
      effusions after thoracoplasties. METHODS: Retrospective study of 45 patients with 
      AIS undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and thoracoplasties. RESULTS: Thirty 
      six out of 45 patients (80.0%) required placement of a deep surgical drain, and 
      16 out of 45 (35.6%) developed pleural effusions after PSF with concomitant 
      thoracoplasty. Of the 16 patients who developed pleural effusion, 12 of 36 
      (33.3%) required a placement of a deep drain (p > 0.05). Of the total 45 patients 
      in this cohort, 3 patients (6.7%) required chest tubes, and 4 patients (8.9%) 
      developed surgical site infections (SSIs). We found that deep drains were 
      associated with a lower incidence of SSI (2.8% vs 33.3%; p = 0.021). Patients who 
      had a pleural effusion had longer ICU stays (p = 0.037) and longer requirements 
      of nasal oxygen (p = 0.025). DISCUSSION: The presence of a pleural effusion in 
      patients with AIS undergoing PSF with thoracoplasty was associated with longer 
      oxygen requirements and length of hospital ICU admission. Thirty six percent of 
      patients with thoracoplasties developed pleural effusions, but deep subfascial 
      drains did not significantly decrease the incidence of pleural effusions.

LID - 10.1159/000496693 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate surgical risk factors in neuromuscular 
      scoliosis (NMS) with respect to wound site infection after spinal fusion. 
      METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all patients treated surgically 
      for NMS between January 2008 and December 2016 (minimum 6 months' follow-up). A 
      sub-cohort of 60 patients with minimum 2 years of follow-up data was also 
      analyzed. RESULTS: In 102 patients (53 boys and 49 girls), the mean age at 
      surgery was 14.0 years (SD ±2.7). Mean follow-up was 2.53 years (±1.66), and mean 
      time to presentation of infection was 2.14 months (±4.95). The overall 
      perioperative complication rate was 26.5%, with 14.7% of patients developing deep 
      wound infection. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 60% of infections; 
      20% were Gram positive, and 20% involved both types. Pulmonary comorbidities (p = 
      0.007), pre- to postoperative increase in weight (p = 0.010), exaggerated lumbar 
      lordosis at follow-up (p = 0.008), history of seizures (p = 0.046), previous 
      myelomeningocele repair (p = 0.046), and previous operations (p = 0.013) were 
      significant risk factors for infection. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in the 
      pediatric population treated surgically for NMS, wound infection is strongly 
      associated with postoperative increase in body weight, residual lumbar lordosis, 
      pulmonary comorbidity, history of myelomeningocele repair, seizures, and previous 
      operations.

TI  - Crossing the cervicothoracic junction in complex pediatric deformity using 
      anterior cervical discectomy and fusion: a case series.
PG  - 1957-1964
LID - 10.1007/s00381-021-05109-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Proximal instrumentation failure is a challenge in posterior spinal 
      fusions (PSFs) crossing the cervicothoracic junction. High rates of proximal 
      junctional kyphosis (PJK) and loss of fixation have been reported. In this 
      single-center retrospective cohort study, we evaluate the utility of anterior 
      cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in addition to traditional PSF crossing the 
      cervicothoracic junction in order to mitigate implant-related complications. 
      METHODS: All patients who underwent PSF across the cervicothoracic junction with 
      ACDF with 2 years of follow-up data were reviewed. We analyzed clinical, 
      surgical, and radiographic measures such as operative details, presence of PJK, 
      complications, instrumentation migration, curve angles, and vertebral 
      translation. Measurements were compared statistically using paired samples 
      t-tests. RESULTS: Ten patients (6 girls, 4 boys) met inclusion criteria with a 
      mean age at surgery of 12.8 ± 3.3 years and follow-up of 3.38 ± 0.9 years. All 
      patients underwent ACDF (range 1-3 levels), and 8 (80%) underwent traction. The 
      average number of levels fused posteriorly was 16.7 ± 4.7 and anteriorly was 2.4 
      ± 0.7. The major coronal curve averaged 48.8 ± 34.7° preoperatively and 
      23.3±13.3° postoperatively (p = 0.028). The average major sagittal curve was 83.5 
      ± 24.2° preoperatively, resolving to 53.9 ± 25.5° (p=0.001). One patient suffered 
      rod breakage at T7, and another developed symptomatic PJK 19 months 
      postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ACDF procedures added to PSFs 
      crossing the cervicothoracic junction offer promise for reducing risk for 
      instrumentation-related complications. ACDF also significantly helps improve and 
      maintain both coronal and sagittal correction over 2 years. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Novel Use of Subcostal Polyethylene Bands to Manage Tumor-Related Scoliosis 
      Requiring Serial Imaging: A Case Report.

AB  - CASE: A 16-year-old male patient with severe kyphoscoliosis, paraplegia, and 
      neurogenic bowel/bladder caused by a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma was treated 
      surgically using a hybrid fusion construct with polyethylene bands after neoplasm 
      resection. Owing to the necessity of serial postoperative magnetic resonance 
      imaging studies to evaluate the recurrence of pathology and known effect of metal 
      artifact from spinal instrumentation, preservation of radiographic resolution was 
      critical. CONCLUSION: We describe the novel utility of polyethylene bands placed 
      around the ribs as a safe and effective form of hybrid construct for reducing 
      radiographic metal artifact in spinal deformity cases requiring serial imaging.

TI  - Single-Staged Management of Pediatric Neuropathic Scoliosis with 
      Intradural-Extramedullary Schwannoma and Improvement in Intraoperative 
      Neuromonitoring: A Case Report.
PG  - e0352
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.CC.19.00352 [doi]
AB  - CASE: A 16-year-old girl with lumbar prominence presented to our outpatient 
      clinic complaining of sporadic back pain without paresthesia. Radiographic 
      investigation revealed a 68° left thoracolumbar curve with the apex at L1. 
      Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging identified a mass at T10-11, subsequently 
      confirmed by pathology as a schwannoma. She was treated surgically with resection 
      and posterior spinal fusion in a single-staged procedure under neuromonitoring 
      guidance. Intraoperative improvement in motor evoked potentials after resection 
      informed the decision to perform simultaneous deformity correction. CONCLUSION: 
      We discuss the unusual coincidence of a schwannoma with scoliosis and our 
      management algorithm based on operative changes in neuromonitoring.

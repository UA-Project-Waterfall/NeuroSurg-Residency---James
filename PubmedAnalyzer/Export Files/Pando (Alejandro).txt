AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nano-sized membrane enclosed vehicles that are 
      involved in cell-to-cell communication and carry cargo that is representative of 
      the parent cell. Recent studies have highlighted the significant roles leukemia 
      EVs play in tumor progression, and ways in which they can lead to treatment 
      evasion, thus meriting further investigation. Leukemia EVs are involved in 
      crosstalk between the leukemia cell and its surroundings, transforming it into a 
      cancer favorable microenvironment. Due to the diverse biological content found in 
      leukemia EVs, they have an assortment of effects on the cells they interact with 
      and can be harnessed as candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments. 
      This review focuses on EVs in the context of leukemia and the means by which they 
      modulate their microenvironment, hematopoiesis, and the immune system to 
      facilitate malignancy. We will also address current and prospective EV-based 
      therapeutics.

TI  - Current landscape of social media use pertaining to glioblastoma by various 
      stakeholders.
PG  - vdad039
LID - 10.1093/noajnl/vdad039 [doi]
LID - vdad039
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the potential for social media to allow widespread public 
      engagement, its role in healthcare, including in cancer care as a support 
      network, is garnering interest. To date, the use of social media in 
      neuro-oncology has not been systematically explored. In the current manuscript, 
      we sought to review Twitter use on glioblastoma among patients, caregivers, 
      providers, researchers, and other stakeholders. METHODS: The Twitter application 
      programming interface (API) database was surveyed from inception to May 2022 to 
      identify tweets about glioblastoma. Number of tweet likes, retweets, quotes, and 
      total engagement were noted for each tweet. Geographic location, number of 
      followers, and number of Tweets were noted for users. We also categorized Tweets 
      based on their underlying themes. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm 
      was used to assign a polarity score, subjectivity score, and analysis label to 
      each Tweet for sentiment analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1690 unique tweets from 
      1000 accounts were included in our analyses. The frequency of tweets increased 
      from 2013 and peaked in 2018. The most common category among users was 
      MD/researchers (21.6%, n = 216), followed by Media/News (20%, n = 200) and 
      Business (10.7%); patients or caregivers accounted for only 4.7% (n = 47) while 
      medical centers, journals, and foundations accounted for 5.4%, 3.7%, and 2.1%. 
      The most common subjects that Tweets covered included research (54%), followed by 
      personal experience (18.2%) and raising awareness (14%). In terms of sentiment, 
      43.6% of Tweets were classified as positive, 41.6% as neutral, and 14.9% as 
      negative; a subset analysis of "personal experience" tweets revealed a higher 
      proportion of negative Tweets (31.5%) and less neutral tweets (25%). Only media 
      (β = 8.4; 95% CI [4.4, 12.4]) and follower count (minimally) predicted higher 
      levels of Tweet engagement. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive analysis of tweets on 
      glioblastoma found that the academic community are the most common user group on 
      Twitter. Sentiment analysis revealed that most negative tweets are related to 
      personal experience. These analyses provide the basis for further work into 
      supporting and developing the care of patients with glioblastoma.

TI  - Murine Leukemia-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Elicit Antitumor Immune Response.
PG  - 277-285
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S308861 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous lipid bilayer 
      particles secreted by cells. EVs contain proteins, RNA, DNA and other cargo that 
      can have immunomodulatory effects. Cancer-derived EVs have been described as 
      having immunomodulating effects in vivo with immunosuppressive and pro-tumor 
      growth capabilities. However, cancer-derived EVs have also been harnessed and 
      utilized for anti-cancer potential. METHODS: To assess the immunomodulatory 
      effect of EVs produced by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we isolated 
      vesicles secreted by the murine AML cell line, C1498, and investigated their 
      effect on in vitro and in vivo immune responses. RESULTS: These leukemia-derived 
      EVs were found to induce increased proliferation of CD3+ cells and enhanced 
      cytolytic activity of CD3+ cells directed toward leukemic cells in vitro. 
      Injection of leukemia-derived EVs into syngeneic naïve mice induced T cell 
      responses in vivo and resulted in enhanced immune responses upon T cell 
      re-stimulation in vitro. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that C1498-derived 
      EVs have immunomodulatory effects on cell-mediated immune responses that could 
      potentially be utilized to facilitate anti-leukemia immune responses.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after elective lumbar spinal fusion: Who is at 
      risk?
PG  - 3560-3565
LID - 10.1007/s00586-022-07383-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CSF leaks are a known complication of lumbar fusion surgery. There is a 
      scarcity of literature describing the incidence and risk factors associated with 
      this complication. The aim of this study was to identify patients who are at risk 
      of developing postoperative CSF leak. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 
      database was used to identify patients who had lumbar fusion in the US from 2002 
      to 2014. Inpatient outcomes included the incidence and risk of developing CSF 
      leak based on selected patient-specific characteristics. Secondary outcomes 
      included average length of stay, mean costs, and mortality rates. All statistical 
      analyses were conducted based on multivariate regression models using the SPSS 
      software. RESULTS: A total of 439,220 patients who underwent elective lumbar 
      fusion procedures were identified. Of these patients, 2.6% (11,636 /439,220) were 
      found to have CSF leak. Independent important risk factors for CSF leak 
      development included: older age (OR: 1.025; 95% CI: 1.02-1.03; p < 0.0001), 
      posterior approach (OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.59-1.85; p < 0.0001) compared to anterior 
      approach, chronic deficiency anemia (OR: 1.21; 95% CI:1.14-1.30; p < 0.0001), 
      obesity (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.15-1.30; p < 0.0001), and pulmonary circulatory 
      disease (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.18-1.75; p < 0.0001). CSF leak was associated with 
      increased length of stay (5.39 ± 3.86 vs. 3.74 ± 2.55; p < 0.0001), 
      hospitalization costs (120,129.0 ± 88,123.5 vs. 89,226.8 ± 65,350.3; p < 0.0001) 
      and mortality (0.3% vs. 0.1%; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons should be 
      aware of certain patient and procedure-specific characteristics that increase the 
      risk of developing postoperative CSF leak after lumbar fusion in order to improve 
      patient outcomes.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are excreted from all cells in the human body and 
      are heterogeneous lipid bilayer particles containing proteins, RNA, DNA, and 
      other cargo. T cells are primary players of the adaptive immune system and have a 
      significant role in anti-cancer immunotherapies. Tumor derived EVs have diverse 
      effects on host cells including modulating the immune response. In this study, we 
      investigate the role acute myeloid leukemia (AML) derived EVs have on modulation 
      of gene expression levels in three different T cell populations (CD8+, CD4+, and 
      CD4 + CD39 + T cells). AML derived EVs modulate gene expression levels in all 
      three cell populations with transcripts associated with major immunoregulatory 
      pathways being significantly altered. Genes whose expression were significantly 
      upregulated or downregulated were analyzed for gene ontogeny category expression 
      and for the impact of the changes on specific immunoregulatory pathways. CD8 + T 
      cells were modulated to a larger extent than other T cell populations and gene 
      expression levels associated with proliferation and differentiation were 
      influenced by AML-derived EVs.

TI  - Vegetative state is a pejorative term.
PG  - 345-7
LID - 10.3233/NRE-2012-00802 [doi]
AB  - The term persistent vegetative state (PVS) refers to the only circumstance in 
      which an apparent dissociation of both components of consciousness is found, 
      characterized by preservation of wakefulness with an apparent loss of awareness. 
      Several authors have recently demonstrated by functional neuroimaging studies 
      that a small subset of unresponsive "vegetative" patients may show unambiguous 
      signs of consciousness and command following that is inaccessible to clinical 
      examination at the bedside. The term "estado vegetativo" used in Spanish to 
      describe the PVS syndrome by physicians came from the English-Spanish 
      translation. The Spanish term "vegetativo" is related to unconscious vital 
      functions, and "vegetal" is relative to plants. According to our experience, when 
      a physician informs to patients' relatives that his/her family member's diagnosis 
      is a "estado vegetativo", they understand the he/she is no more a human being, 
      that there is no hope of recovery. The European Task Force on Disorders of 
      Consciousness has recently proposed a new term, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome 
      (UWS), to assist society in avoiding the depreciatory term vegetative state. Our 
      group has embraced the use of the new term UWS and might suggest that we change 
      our concept and use of the term MCS to minimally responsive wakefulness state 
      (MRWS), or minimally aware wakefulness state (MAWS). Medical terms must be 
      current and avoid any pejorative description of patients, which will promote our 
      abilities to serve humankind and challenge neuroscientists to offer society new 
      and realistic hopes for neurorehabilitation.

TI  - Robotic assistance in lumbar fusion surgery: trends and patterns from 2016-2019.
PG  - 1966-1972
LID - 10.1007/s00586-023-07663-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted spine surgery is an emerging field that is growing in 
      utilization. Intraoperative robotic surgical units cost upwards of $600,000 for 
      medical facilities to purchase. Despite significant cost barriers, these devices 
      are highly marketable for hospitals and physicians. METHODS: The Nationwide 
      Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2019 was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were 
      patients over 18 years of age who underwent elective lumbar spinal fusion. Trends 
      of robotic-assisted lumbar fusion were examined over time, as well as stratified 
      based on patient and surgical characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 176,377 
      patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall rate of robotic-assisted lumbar 
      fusion was 1.2% (2,131/174,246). Patients with private insurance were more likely 
      to receive robotic-assisted lumbar fusion (40.3% vs. 37.5%; p < 0.05). 
      Stratifying by race, whites were more likely to receive robotic-assisted lumbar 
      fusion (84.1% vs. 79.5%; p < 0.05). Patients who underwent robotic-assisted 
      lumbar fusion were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of 
      spondylolisthesis compared to those that underwent non-robotic-assisted lumbar 
      fusion (25.9% vs. 22.0%; p < 0.05). Patients with lumbar fusion done via the 
      anterior approach were more likely to have robotic-assisted surgery compared to 
      other approaches (25.2% vs. 21.3; p < 0.05). Overall, there was a steady increase 
      in its use over time, with patients who underwent lumbar fusion procedures four 
      times more likely to receive robotic assistance in 2019 compared to 2016 (OR: 
      4.0; 95% CI: 3.5-4.6; p < 0.0001). Robotic-assisted lumbar fusion was associated 
      with higher inpatient costs ($170,036.40 vs. $139,026.10; p < 0.0001) despite 
      having equivalent length of stay (3.31 ± 2.6 vs.3.37 ± 2.6; p = 0.06). 
      CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted lumbar fusion is on the rise. Patients who had 
      private insurance, were diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, and who had lumbar 
      fusion via the anterior approach were more likely to undergo lumbar fusion using 
      robotic assistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-grade glioma has a poor overall survival with profoundly 
      negative effects on the patient's quality of life and their caregivers. In this 
      study, we investigate the factors associated with receiving palliative care in 
      patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) and the association of receiving or 
      not receiving palliative care with overall survival. METHODS: The National Cancer 
      Database was analyzed for patterns of care in patients ≥18 years old who were 
      diagnosed with histologically confirmed grade IV GBM between 2004 and 2017. All 
      statistical analyses were conducted based on univariate and multivariate 
      regression models. RESULTS: A total of 85,380 patients with the diagnosis of GBM 
      were identified. Of the study population, 2803 patients (3.28%) received 
      palliative therapy. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age ≥70 years 
      (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.58; P < 0.001), 
      Medicare (OR, 1.348; CI, 1.13-1.61; P = 0.001), tumor size ≥5 cm (OR, 1.15; CI, 
      1.01-1.31; P = 0.036), tumor multifocality (OR, 1.69; CI, 1.47-1.96; P < 0.001), 
      lobe overlapping tumor (OR, 2.09; CI, 1.13-3.86; P = 0.018), Charlson-Deyo score 
      >0, receiving treatment at a nonacademic/research program, and medium volume of 
      cancers managed at the treatment facility (OR, 1.19; CI, 1.02-1.38; P = 0.026) 
      were independent risk factors associated with an increased chance of receiving 
      palliative care. In contrast, a household income of ≥$40,227 and high volume of 
      cancer managed at the treatment facility (OR, 0.75; CI, 0.58-0.96; P = 0.02) were 
      independent risk factors associated with decreased palliative care. Patients who 
      received no palliative care had a 2-year overall survival longer than those who 
      received palliative care (22% vs. 8.8%; P < 0.001). In patients receiving 
      palliative care, those who received recommended treatment had a 2-year overall 
      survival longer than those who declined part or whole recommended treatment (9.1% 
      vs. 3.8%; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with high-grade glioma, receiving 
      palliative care is associated with decreased survival. When receiving palliative 
      care, recommended treatment increases the number of patients who survive more 
      than 2 years approximately 3-fold compared with those declining part or whole 
      treatment.

      Octogenarians with Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis: Real-World Evidence from a 
      National Surgical Quality Registry.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcomes of carotid revascularization among octogenarians are not 
      well studied. We present analyses of 30-day stroke and mortality of patients aged 
      ≥80 years using real-world data from a national surgical quality registry. 
      METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program targeted data set for 
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) was 
      queried for patients aged ≥80 years undergoing CEA and CAS between 2012 and 2019. 
      RESULTS: A total of 122 and 3013 patients aged ≥80 years with symptomatic carotid 
      stenosis undergoing CAS and CEA, respectively, were identified. Patients with CAS 
      were more likely to be older than 90 years (P = 0.006) and have diabetes (P = 
      0.036), were more likely to have high-risk anatomy (P < 0.001), but had lower 
      American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P < 0.001). An ipsilateral stroke 
      had been experienced by 43.6% of patients with CAS and 44.7% of patients with 
      CEA. The rate of 30-day composite outcome was 6.4% in the CAS group and 4.5% in 
      the CEA group (P = 0.326). The f 30-day mortality was significantly higher for 
      CAS (5.6% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.001); however, the difference between the cohorts was 
      not significant (CAS, 2.4% vs. CEA, 3.4%, P = 0.555). On multivariable analysis, 
      CEA was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 
      0.32; P = 0.0145). Symptom presentation other than ipsilateral stroke was 
      associated with significantly decreased odds of 30-day outcome (amaurosis 
      fugax/transient monocular blindness, OR, 0.39, P = 0.004; transient ischemic 
      attack, OR, 0.57, P = 0.003), whereas higher age had significantly increased odds 
      (OR, 1.95; P = 0.0172). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world analyses from a surgical quality 
      registry show that CEA may be associated with lower odds of mortality compared 
      with CAS among octogenarians.

TI  - Brain death diagnosis and apnea test safety.
PG  - 197-200
LID - 10.4103/0972-2327.56326 [doi]
AB  - The apnea test is a mandatory examination for determining brain death (BD), 
      because it provides an essential sign of definitive loss of brainstem function. 
      However, several authors have expressed their concern about the safety of this 
      procedure as there are potential complications such as severe hypotension, 
      pneumothorax, excessive hypercarbia, hypoxia, acidosis, and cardiac arrhythmia or 
      asystole. These complications may constrain the examiner to abort the test, 
      thereby compromising BD diagnosis. Nevertheless, when an appropriate 
      oxygen-diffusion procedure is used, this technique is safe. We review here the 
      prerequisites to begin the test, its procedure, potential complications, and the 
      use of alternative ancillary tests. We recommend that the apnea test be retained 
      as a mandatory procedure for the diagnosis of BD. In those situations when the 
      apnea test is terminated by the examiner for some reason or when it is impossible 
      to carry it out in a patient due to the presence of some pathologic condition, 
      alternative ancillary tests should be used to confirm BD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media outlets such as Instagram have recently become a popular 
      tool for medical professionals to disseminate medical information to a large 
      public audience. In this study, we identify the top neurosurgery influencers on 
      Instagram and analyze trends between content type, audience interaction, and user 
      engagement. METHODS: A list of neurosurgeon Instagram profiles based on the 
      number of followers, user engagement, and average interaction were compiled. 
      Outcome variables such as the numbers of followers, likes, comments, hashtags, 
      caption words, user engagement, and average user activity were collected and 
      analyzed. The most recent 30 posts from each included profile were stratified 
      into categories on the basis of type of content. RESULTS: A total of 73 
      neurologic surgeon "influencer" Instagram profiles met our inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria (67 male [91.8%]; 6 female [8.2%]). Of the most recent 30 
      posts for each influencer, clinical and professional posts represented the 
      majority (67.4%), while lifestyle and patient posts made up 30.3% and 2.3%, 
      respectively. In comparison to the rest of the field (n = 43), the 30 profiles 
      with the most followers had a significantly higher average interaction (418.77 
      vs. 126.79; P < 0.001), number of uploads (578.87 vs. 184.58; P = 0.004), average 
      number of likes given in the top posts (770.71 vs. 2150.40; P < 0.001), average 
      posts per week (2.40 vs. 1.12; P = 0.041), and average posts per month (9.91 vs. 
      4.02.; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeon influencers on Instagram post 
      content that predominantly features educational and academic subject matter. Post 
      content regarding the individual's personal life or extracurricular activities 
      made up a lesser portion of content, and there were few posts categorized as 
      patient testimonials.

TI  - Induction of anti-leukemic responses by stimulation of leukemic CD3+ cells with 
      allogeneic stimulator cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapeutic protocols have focused on identification of stimuli 
      that induce effective anti-leukemic immune responses. One potent immune stimulus 
      is the encounter with allogeneic cells. Our group previously showed that the 
      infusion of haploidentical donor white blood cells (1-2 × 10(8) CD3+ cells/kg) 
      into patients with refractory hematological malignancies induced responses of 
      varying magnitude in over half of the patients. Because donor cells were 
      eliminated within 2 weeks in these patients, it is presumed that the responses of 
      recipient lymphocytes were critically important in achieving prolonged 
      anti-leukemic responses. METHODS: The role of patient CD3+ cells in anti-leukemic 
      responses was examined by isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from newly 
      diagnosed leukemic patients. Immunophenotyping was performed on these peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells. CD3+ cells were isolated from the peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells and tested for their ability to proliferate and lyse autologous 
      leukemic cells when stimulated with unrelated allogeneic cells. RESULTS: 
      Allostimulated CD3+ cells effectively generated cytolytic responses to autologous 
      CD3-cells in 11/21 patients. Increased numbers of CD4+ cells expressing high 
      levels of granzyme A, B and perforin and CD8+CD39+ cells were found in 
      nonresponsive CD3+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CD3+ cells 
      from leukemic patients are capable of generating anti-leukemic responses when 
      stimulated with unrelated allogeneic cells. This model can be used to identify 
      approaches using alloreactive responses by patient lymphocytes to enhance in vivo 
      anti-leukemic responses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most surgical journals are published in English, representing a 
      challenge for researchers from non-Anglophone countries. We describe the 
      implementation, workflow, outcomes, and lessons learned from the WORLD 
      NEUROSURGERY Global Champions Program (GCP), a novel journal-specific English 
      language editing program for articles rejected because of poor English grammar or 
      usage. METHODS: The GCP was advertised via the journal website and social media. 
      Applicants were selected to be a reviewer for the GCP if they demonstrated 
      English proficiency on writing samples supplied in their application. The 
      demographics of GCP members and characteristics and outcomes of articles edited 
      by the GCP during its first year were reviewed. Surveys of GCP members and 
      authors who used the service were conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-one individuals 
      became part of the GCP, representing 8 countries and 16 languages apart from 
      English. A total of 380 manuscripts were peer reviewed by the editor-in-chief, 
      who determined these manuscripts to have potentially worthwhile content but 
      needed to be rejected due to poor language. The authors of these manuscripts were 
      informed of the existence of this language assistance program. Forty-nine 
      articles (12.9%) were edited by the GCP in 41.6 ± 22.8 days. Of 40 articles 
      resubmitted to WORLD NEUROSURGERY, 24 (60.0%) were accepted. GCP members and 
      authors understood the purpose and workflow of the program and recognized 
      improvements in article quality and the probability of acceptance through their 
      participation. CONCLUSIONS: The WORLD NEUROSURGERY Global Champions Program 
      mitigated a critical barrier to publication in an English language journal for 
      authors from non-Anglophone countries. This program promotes research equity by 
      providing a free, largely medical student and trainee operated, English language 
      editing service. This model or a similar service can be replicated by other 
      journals.

LID - 10.37757/MR2012V14.N1.3 [doi]
AB  - The Cuban Group for Study of Disorders of Consciousness is developing several 
      research protocols to search for possible preservation of residual brain and 
      autonomic functions in cases of persistent vegetative and minimally conscious 
      states. We present examples showing the importance of 3D anatomic reconstruction 
      of brain structures and MRI tractography for assessing white matter connectivity. 
      We also present results of use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
      technique to follow up cognitive recovery in persistent vegetative state patients 
      transitioning to minimally conscious state. We have demonstrated recognition of a 
      mother's voice with emotional content after zolpidem administration, indicating 
      high-level residual linguistic processing and brain activation despite the 
      patient's apparent inability to communicate. Hence we differ with current 
      thinking that, by definition, subjects in persistent vegetative state are 
      isolated from the outside world and cannot experience pain and suffering. We also 
      consider "vegetative state" a pejorative term that should be replaced. KEYWORDS 
      Persistent vegetative state, minimally conscious state, consciousness disorders, 
      magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, heart rate variability.

TI  - Rapid Implementation of a 3-Dimensional-Printed Patient-Specific Titanium Sacrum 
      Implant for Severe Neuropathic Spinal Arthropathy and Guide to Compassionate US 
      Regulatory Approval.
PG  - 469-477
LID - 10.1227/ons.0000000000000872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rapid design and production of patient-specific 
      3-dimensional-printed implants (3DPIs) present a novel opportunity to restore the 
      biomechanically demanding integrity of the lumbopelvic junction. We present a 
      unique case of a 61-year-old patient with severe neuropathic spinal arthropathy 
      (Charcot spine) who initially underwent a T4-to-sacrum spinal fusion. Massive 
      bone destruction led to dissociation of his upper body from his pelvis and legs. 
      Reconstruction of the spinopelvic continuity was planned with the aid of a 
      personalized lumbosacral 3DPI. METHOD: Using high-resolution computed tomography 
      scans, the custom 3DPI was made using additive titanium manufacturing. The unique 
      3DPI consisted of (1) a sacral platform with iliac screws, (2) modular corpectomy 
      device with rigid connection to the sacral platform, and (3) anterior plate 
      connection with screws for proximal fixation. The procedures to obtain 
      compassionate use Food and Drug Administration approval were followed. The 
      patient underwent debridement of a chronically open wound before undertaking the 
      3-stage reconstructive procedure. The custom 3DPI and additional instrumentation 
      were inserted as part of a salvage rebuilding procedure. RESULTS: The chronology 
      of the rapid implementation of the personalized sacral 3DPI from decision, 
      design, manufacturing, Food and Drug Administration approval, and surgical 
      execution lasted 28 days. The prosthesis was positioned in the defect according 
      to the expected anatomic planes and secured using a screw-rod system and a 
      vascularized fibular bone strut graft. The prosthesis provided an ideal repair of 
      the lumbosacral junction and pelvic ring by merging spinal pelvic fixation, 
      posterior pelvic ring fixation, and anterior spinal column fixation. CONCLUSION: 
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a multilevel lumbar, 
      sacral, and sacropelvic neuropathic (Charcot) spine reconstruction using a 3DPI 
      sacral prosthesis. As the prevalence of severe spine deformities continues to 
      increase, adoption of 3DPIs is becoming more relevant to offer personalized 
      treatment for complex deformities.

TI  - Assessing acute middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke by quantitative electric 
      tomography.
PG  - 116-24
AB  - This paper focuses on the application of quantitative electric tomography (qEEGT) 
      to map changes in EEG generators for detection of early signs of ischemia in 
      patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke. Thirty-two patients were 
      studied with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke of the left middle cerebral 
      artery territory, within the first 24 hours of their clinical evolution. Variable 
      Resolution Electrical Tomography was used for estimating EEG source generators. 
      High resolution source Z-spectra and 3- dimensional images of Z values for all 
      the sources at each frequency were obtained for all cases. To estimate 
      statistically significant increments and decrements of brain electric activity 
      within the frequency spectra, the t-Student vs. Zero test was performed. A 
      significant increment of delta activity was observed on the affected vascular 
      territory, and a more extensive increment of theta activity was detected. A 
      significant alpha decrement was found in the parieto-occipital region of the 
      affected cerebral hemisphere (left), and in the medial and posterior region of 
      the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that qEEGT Z delta images are 
      probably related to the main ischemic core within the affected arterial 
      territory; penumbra, diaschisis, edema, might explain those observed theta and 
      alpha abnormalities. It was concluded that qEEGT is useful for the detection of 
      early signs of ischemia in acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - Eye-Movement Training Results in Changes in qEEG and NIH Stroke Scale in Subjects 
      Suffering from Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Ischemic Stroke: A Randomized Control 
      Trial.
PG  - 3

AB  - CONTEXT: Eye-movement training (EMT) can induce altered brain activation and 
      change the functionality of saccades with changes of the brain in general. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if EMT would result in changes in quantitative 
      electroencephalogram (qEEG) and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in patients suffering 
      from acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. Our hypothesis is that there 
      would be positive changes in qEEG and NIHSS after EMT in patients suffering from 
      acute MCA ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four subjects with acute MCA ischemic stroke 
      treated at university affiliated hospital intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Subjects were randomized into a "control" group treated only with aspirin 
      (125 mg/day) and a "treatment" group treated with aspirin (125 mg/day) and a 
      subject-specific EMT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Delta-alpha ratio, power ratio 
      index, and the brain symmetry index calculated by qEEG and NIHSS. RESULTS: There 
      was strong statistical and substantive significant improvement in all outcome 
      measures for the group of stroke patients undergoing EMT. Such improvement was 
      not observed for the "control" group, and there were no adverse effects. 
      CONCLUSION: The addition of EMT to a MCA ischemic stroke treatment paradigm has 
      demonstrated statistically significant changes in outcome measures and is a low 
      cost, safe, and effective complement to standard treatment.

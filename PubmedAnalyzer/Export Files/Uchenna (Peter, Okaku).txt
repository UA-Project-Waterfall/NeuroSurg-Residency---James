TI  - Global pediatric craniopharyngioma management modalities and outcomes.
PG  - 47-56

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pediatric craniopharyngioma is a complex pathology, with optimal 
      management involving a multidisciplinary approach and thoughtful care 
      coordination. To date, no studies have compared various treatment modalities and 
      outcomes described in different global regions. We conducted a comprehensive 
      systematic review to compare demographics, clinical presentation, treatment 
      approach and outcomes of children diagnosed with craniopharyngioma globally. 
      METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred 
      Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 
      Search terms included "craniopharyngioma" and country-specific terms. Inclusion 
      criteria included full-text studies published between 2000-2022, primarily 
      examining pediatric patients 18-years old or younger diagnosed with 
      craniopharyngioma, and reporting management and outcomes of interest. Data 
      extracted included country of origin, demographical data, initial presentation 
      and treatment modality, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics and between-group 
      comparisons based on country of origin were performed. RESULTS: Of 797 search 
      results, 35 articles were included, mostly originating from high-income countries 
      (HIC) (n = 25, 71.4%). No studies originated from low-income countries (LIC). 
      When comparing HIC to middle-income countries (MIC), no differences in patient 
      demographics were observed. No differences in symptomatology at initial 
      presentation, tumor type, surgical approach or extent of surgical resection were 
      observed. HIC patients undergoing intracystic therapy were more likely to receive 
      bleomycin (n = 48, 85.7%), while the majority of MIC patients received interferon 
      therapy (n = 10, 62.5%). All MIC patients undergoing radiation therapy underwent 
      photon therapy (n = 102). No statistically significant differences were observed 
      in postoperative complications or mean follow-up duration between HIC and MIC 
      (78.1 ± 32.2 vs. 58.5 ± 32.1 months, p = 0.241). CONCLUSION: Pediatric 
      craniopharyngioma presents and is managed similarly across the globe. However, no 
      studies originating from LICs and resource-poor regions examine presentation and 
      management to date, representing a significant knowledge gap that must be 
      addressed to complete the global picture of pediatric craniopharyngioma burden 
      and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a controversy on the effectiveness of post-operating 
      splinting in patients with carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery. This study aimed 
      to systematically evaluate various outcomes regarding the effectiveness of 
      post-operating splinting in CTR surgery. METHODS: Multiple databases, including 
      PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane, were searched for terms 
      related to carpal tunnel syndrome. A total of eight studies involving 596 
      patients were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of studies was 
      evaluated, and their risk of bias was calculated using the methodological index 
      for non-randomized studies (MINORS) and Cochrane's collaboration tool for 
      assessing the risk of bias in randomized controlled trials. Data including the 
      visual analogue scale (VAS), pinch strength, grip strength, two-point 
      discrimination, symptom severity score (SSS), and functional status scale (FSS) 
      were extracted. RESULTS: Our analysis showed no significant differences between 
      the splinted and non-splinted groups based on the VAS, SSS, FSS, grip strength, 
      pinch strength, and two-point discrimination. The calculated values of the 
      standardized mean difference (SMD) or the weighted mean difference (WMD) and a 
      95% confidence interval (CI) for different variables were as follows: VAS 
      [SMD = 0.004, 95% CI (-0.214, 0.222)], pinch strength [WMD = 1.061, 95% CI 
      (-0.559, 2.681)], grip strength [SMD = 0.178, 95% CI (-0.014, 0.369)], SSS 
      [WMD = 0.026, 95% CI (- 0.191, 0.242)], FSS [SMD = 0.089, 95% CI (-0.092, 
      0.269)], and the two-point discrimination [SMD = 0.557, 95% CI (-0.140, 1.253)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed no statistically significant differences 
      between the splinted and non-splinted groups in terms of the VAS, SSS, FSS, grip 
      strength, pinch strength, and two-point discrimination. These results indicate 
      that there is no substantial evidence supporting a significant advantage of 
      post-operative splinting after CTR.

TI  - A comprehensive analysis of the triad of frailty, aging, and obesity in spine

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The United States has experienced substantial shifts in its 
      population dynamics due to an aging population and increasing obesity rates. 
      Nonetheless, there is limited data about the interplay between the triad of 
      frailty, aging, and obesity. PURPOSE: To investigate discriminative thresholds 
      and independent associations of the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), Modified Frailty 
      Index-5 (mFI-5), and greater patient age. STUDY DESIGN: An observational 
      retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: We analyzed 49,754 spine surgery 
      patients from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program database from 2012 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASURE: A total of 
      30-day postoperative mortality. METHODS: Using receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) and multivariable (odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [CI]) 
      analyses, we compared the discriminative thresholds and independent associations 
      of RAI, mFI-5, and greater patient age in elderly obese patients who underwent 
      spine surgery. RESULTS: There were 49,754 spine surgery patients, with a median 
      age of 71 years (IQR: 68-75), largely white (82.6%) and male (51.9%). The ROC 
      analysis for 30-day postoperative mortality demonstrated superior discrimination 
      for RAI (C-statistic 0.779, 95%CI 0.54-0.805) compared to mFI-5 (C-statistic 
      0.623, 95% CI 0.594-0.651) and greater patient age (C-statistic 0.627, 95% CI 
      0.598-0.656). Multivariable analyses revealed a dose-dependent association and a 
      larger effect magnitude for RAI: frail patients OR: 19.52 (95% CI 18.29-20.82) 
      and very frail patients OR: 65.81 (95% CI 62.32-69.50). A similar trend was 
      observed in the interaction evaluating RAI-age-obesity (p<.001). CONCLUSION: Our 
      study highlights a strong association between frailty and 30-day postoperative 
      mortality in elderly obese spine patients, revealing a dose-dependent 
      relationship. The RAI has superior discrimination than the mFI-5 and greater 
      patient age in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality after spine surgery. 
      Using the RAI in preoperative assessments may improve outcomes and help 
      healthcare providers effectively communicate accurate surgical risks and 
      potential benefits, set realistic recovery expectations, and enhances patient 
      satisfaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a global health challenge that affects a large 
      proportion of adults worldwide. Obesity and frailty pose considerable health 
      risks due to their potential to interact and amplify one another's negative 
      effects. Therefore, we sought to compare the discriminatory thresholds of the 
      risk analysis index (RAI), 5-factor modified frailty index (m-FI-5) and patient 
      age for the primary endpoint of postoperative mortality. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We 
      included spine surgery patients ≥18 years old, from the American College of 
      Surgeons National Quality Improvement program database from 2012-2020, that were 
      classified as obese. We performed receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis to compare the discrimination threshold of RAI, mFI-5, and patient age 
      for postoperative mortality. Proportional hazards risk-adjusted regressions were 
      performed, and Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% Confidence intervals (CI) are 
      reported. RESULTS: Overall, there were 149 163 patients evaluated, and in the ROC 
      analysis for postoperative mortality, RAI showed superior discrimination 
      C-statistic 0.793 (95%CI: 0.773-0.813), compared to mFI-5 C-statistic 0.671 
      (95%CI 0.650-0.691), and patient age C-statistic 0.686 (95%CI 0.666-0.707). 
      Risk-adjusted analyses were performed, and the RAI had a stepwise increasing 
      effect size across frailty strata: typical patients HR 2.55 (95%CI 2.03-3.19), 
      frail patients HR 3.48 (95%CI 2.49-4.86), and very frail patients HR 4.90 (95%CI 
      2.87-8.37). We found increasing postoperative mortality effect sizes within 
      Clavein-Dindo complication strata, consistent across obesity categories, 
      exponentially increasing with frailty, and multiplicatively enhanced within CD, 
      frailty and obesity strata. CONCLUSION: In this study of 149 163 patients 
      classified as obese and undergoing spine procedures in an international 
      prospective surgical database, the RAI demonstrated superior discrimination 
      compared to the mFI-5 and patient age in predicting postoperative mortality risk. 
      The deleterious effects of frailty and obesity were synergistic as their combined 
      effect predicted worse outcomes.

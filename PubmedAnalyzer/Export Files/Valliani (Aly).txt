AB  - Deciphering the massive volume of complex electronic data that has been compiled 
      by hospital systems over the past decades has the potential to revolutionize 
      modern medicine, as well as present significant challenges. Deep learning is 
      uniquely suited to address these challenges, and recent advances in techniques 
      and hardware have poised the field of medical machine learning for 
      transformational growth. The clinical neurosciences are particularly well 
      positioned to benefit from these advances given the subtle presentation of 
      symptoms typical of neurologic disease. Here we review the various domains in 
      which deep learning algorithms have already provided impetus for change-areas 
      such as medical image analysis for the improved diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
      and the early detection of acute neurologic events; medical image segmentation 
      for quantitative evaluation of neuroanatomy and vasculature; connectome mapping 
      for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder; and mining of microscopic electroencephalogram signals 
      and granular genetic signatures. We additionally note important challenges in the 
      integration of deep learning tools in the clinical setting and discuss the 
      barriers to tackling the challenges that currently exist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials are essential for assessing the advancements in spine 
      tumor therapeutics. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the 
      trends in clinical trials for primary and metastatic tumor treatment during the 
      past 2 decades. METHODS: The ClinicalTrials.gov database was queried using the 
      search term "spine" for all interventional studies from 1999 to 2020 with the 
      categories of "cancer," "neoplasm," "tumor," and/or "metastasis." The tumor type, 
      phase data, enrollment numbers, and home institution country were recorded. The 
      sponsor was categorized as an academic institution, industry, government, or 
      other and the intervention type as procedure, drug, device, radiation therapy, or 
      other. The frequency of each category and the cumulative frequency during the 
      20-year period were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 106 registered trials for 
      spine tumors were listed. All, except for 2, that had begun before 2008 had been 
      completed. An enrollment of 51-100 participants (29.8%) was the most common, and 
      most were phase II studies (54.4%). Most of the studies had examined metastatic 
      tumors (58.5%), and the number of new trials annually had increased 3.4-fold from 
      2009 to 2020. Most of the studies had been conducted in the United States 
      (56.4%). The most common intervention strategy was radiation therapy (32.1%), 
      although from 2010 to 2020, procedural studies had become the most frequent 
      (2.4/year). Most of the studies had been sponsored by academic institutions 
      (63.2%), which during the 20-year period had sponsored 3.2-fold more studies 
      compared with the industry partners. CONCLUSIONS: The number of clinical trials 
      for spine tumor therapies has rapidly increased during the past 15 years, owing 
      to studies at U.S. academic medical institutions investigating radiosurgery for 
      the treatment of metastases. Targeted therapies for tumor subtypes and sequelae 
      have updated international best practices.

AB  - »: Machine learning and artificial intelligence have seen tremendous growth in 
      recent years and have been applied in numerous studies in the field of 
      orthopaedics. »: Machine learning will soon become critical in the day-to-day 
      operations of orthopaedic practice; therefore, it is imperative that providers 
      become accustomed to and familiar with not only the terminology but also the 
      fundamental techniques behind the technology. »: A foundation of knowledge 
      regarding machine learning is critical for physicians so they can begin to 
      understand the details in the algorithms that are being developed, which provide 
      improved accuracy compared with clinicians, decreased time required, and a 
      heightened ability to triage patients.

AB  - Vision impairment continues to be a major global problem, as the WHO estimates 
      2.2 billion people struggling with vision loss or blindness. One billion of these 
      cases, however, can be prevented by expanding diagnostic capabilities. Direct 
      global healthcare costs associated with these conditions totaled $255 billion in 
      2010, with a rapid upward projection to $294 billion in 2020. Accordingly, WHO 
      proposed 2030 targets to enhance integration and patient-centered vision care by 
      expanding refractive error and cataract worldwide coverage. Due to the 
      limitations in cost and portability of adapted vision screening models, there is 
      a clear need for new, more accessible vision testing tools in vision care. This 
      comparative, systematic review highlights the need for new ophthalmic equipment 
      and approaches while looking at existing and emerging technologies that could 
      expand the capacity for disease identification and access to diagnostic tools. 
      Specifically, the review focuses on portable hardware- and software-centered 
      strategies that can be deployed in remote locations for detection of ophthalmic 
      conditions and refractive error. Advancements in portable hardware, automated 
      software screening tools, and big data-centric analytics, including machine 
      learning, may provide an avenue for improving ophthalmic healthcare.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative navigation during spine surgery improves pedicle 
      screw placement accuracy. However, limited studies have correlated the use of 
      navigation with clinical factors, including operative time and safety. In the 
      present study, we compared the complications and reoperations between surgeries 
      with and without navigation. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement 
      Project database was queried for posterior cervical and lumbar fusions and 
      deformity surgeries from 2011 to 2018 and divided by navigation use. Patients 
      aged >89 years, patients with deformity aged <25 years, and patients undergoing 
      surgery for tumors, fractures, infections, or nonelective indications were 
      excluded. The demographics and perioperative factors were compared via univariate 
      analysis. The outcomes were compared using multivariable logistic regression 
      adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      class, surgical region, and multiple treatment levels. The outcomes were also 
      compared stratifying by revision status. RESULTS: Navigation surgery patients had 
      had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P < 0.0001), more 
      multiple level surgeries (P < 0.0001), and longer operative times (P < 0.0001). 
      The adjusted analysis revealed that navigated lumbar surgery had lower odds of 
      complications (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.90; P 
      < 0.0001), blood transfusion (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87; P < 0.0001), and wound 
      debridement and/or drainage (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.97; P = 0.04) compared with 
      non-navigated lumbar surgery. Navigated cervical fusions had increased odds of 
      transfusions (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.23; P = 0.02). Navigated primary fusion 
      had decreased odds of complications (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98; P = 0.01). 
      However, no differences were found in revisions (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.14; P = 
      0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Navigated surgery patients experienced longer operations 
      owing to a combination of the time required for navigation, more multilevel 
      procedures, and a larger comorbidity burden, without differences in the incidence 
      of infection. Fewer complications and wound washouts were required for navigated 
      lumbar surgery owing to a greater proportion percentage of minimally invasive 
      cases. The combined use of navigation and minimally invasive surgery might 
      benefit patients with the proper indications.

AB  - The fundamental challenge in machine learning is ensuring that trained models 
      generalize well to unseen data. We developed a general technique for ameliorating 
      the effect of dataset shift using generative adversarial networks (GANs) on a 
      dataset of 149,298 handwritten digits and dataset of 868,549 chest radiographs 
      obtained from four academic medical centers. Efficacy was assessed by comparing 
      area under the curve (AUC) pre- and post-adaptation. On the digit recognition 
      task, the baseline CNN achieved an average internal test AUC of 99.87% (95% CI, 
      99.87-99.87%), which decreased to an average external test AUC of 91.85% (95% CI, 
      91.82-91.88%), with an average salvage of 35% from baseline upon adaptation. On 
      the lung pathology classification task, the baseline CNN achieved an average 
      internal test AUC of 78.07% (95% CI, 77.97-78.17%) and an average external test 
      AUC of 71.43% (95% CI, 71.32-71.60%), with a salvage of 25% from baseline upon 
      adaptation. Adversarial domain adaptation leads to improved model performance on 
      radiographic data derived from multiple out-of-sample healthcare populations. 
      This work can be applied to other medical imaging domains to help shape the 
      deployment toolkit of machine learning in medicine.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to 
      develop and validate a machine learning algorithm for the automated 
      identification of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) plates from 
      smartphone images of anterior-posterior (AP) cervical spine radiographs. SUMMARY 
      OF BACKGROUND DATA: Identification of existing instrumentation is a critical step 
      in planning revision surgery for ACDF. Machine learning algorithms that are known 
      to be adept at image classification may be applied to the problem of ACDF plate 
      identification. METHODS: A total of 402 smartphone images containing 15 different 
      types of ACDF plates were gathered. Two hundred seventy-five images (∼70%) were 
      used to train and validate a convolution neural network (CNN) for classification 
      of images from radiographs. One hundred twenty-seven (∼30%) images were held out 
      to test algorithm performance. RESULTS: The algorithm performed with an overall 
      accuracy of 94.4% and 85.8% for top-3 and top-1 accuracy, respectively. Overall 
      positive predictive value, sensitivity, and f1-scores were 0.873, 0.858, and 
      0.855, respectively. CONCLUSION: This algorithm demonstrates strong performance 
      in the classification of ACDF plates from smartphone images and will be deployed 
      as an accessible smartphone application for further evaluation, improvement, and 
      eventual widespread use.Level of Evidence: 3.

AB  - Real-time seizure detection is a resource intensive process as it requires 
      continuous monitoring of patients on stereoelectroencephalography. This study 
      improves real-time seizure detection in drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients by 
      developing patient-specific deep learning models that utilize a novel 
      self-supervised dynamic thresholding approach. Deep neural networks were 
      constructed on over 2000 h of high-resolution, multichannel SEEG and video 
      recordings from 14 DRE patients. Consensus labels from a panel of epileptologists 
      were used to evaluate model efficacy. Self-supervised dynamic thresholding 
      exhibited improvements in positive predictive value (PPV; difference: 39.0%; 95% 
      CI 4.5-73.5%; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; N = 14; p = 0.03) with similar 
      sensitivity (difference: 14.3%; 95% CI - 21.7 to 50.3%; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 
      test; N = 14; p = 0.42) compared to static thresholds. In some models, training 
      on as little as 10 min of SEEG data yielded robust detection. Cross-testing 
      experiments reduced PPV (difference: 56.5%; 95% CI 25.8-87.3%; 
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; N = 14; p = 0.002), while multimodal detection 
      significantly improved sensitivity (difference: 25.0%; 95% CI 0.2-49.9%; 
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; N = 14; p < 0.05). Self-supervised dynamic 
      thresholding improved the efficacy of real-time seizure predictions. Multimodal 
      models demonstrated potential to improve detection. These findings are promising 
      for future deployment in epilepsy monitoring units to enable real-time seizure 
      detection without annotated data and only minimal training time in individual 
      patients.

LID - 10.3934/mbe.2022320 [doi]
AB  - A significant amount of clinical research is observational by nature and derived 
      from medical records, clinical trials, and large-scale registries. While there is 
      no substitute for randomized, controlled experimentation, such experiments or 
      trials are often costly, time consuming, and even ethically or practically 
      impossible to execute. Combining classical regression and structural equation 
      modeling with matching techniques can leverage the value of observational data. 
      Nevertheless, identifying variables of greatest interest in high-dimensional data 
      is frequently challenging, even with application of classical dimensionality 
      reduction and/or propensity scoring techniques. Here, we demonstrate that 
      projecting high-dimensional medical data onto a lower-dimensional manifold using 
      deep autoencoders and post-hoc generation of treatment/control cohorts based on 
      proximity in the lower-dimensional space results in better matching of 
      confounding variables compared to classical propensity score matching (PSM) in 
      the original high-dimensional space (P<0.0001) and performs similarly to PSM 
      models constructed by experts with prior knowledge of the underlying pathology 
      when evaluated on predicting risk ratios from real-world clinical data. Thus, in 
      cases when the underlying problem is poorly understood and the data is 
      high-dimensional in nature, matching in the autoencoder latent space might be of 
      particular benefit.

TI  - Virtual Reality Hemifield Measurements for Corrective Surgery Eligibility in 
      Ptosis Patients: A Pilot Clinical Trial.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.10.35 [doi]
LID - 35
AB  - PURPOSE: We developed an accelerated virtual reality (VR) suprathreshold 
      hemifield perimetry algorithm, the median cut hemifield test (MCHT). This study 
      examines the ability of the MCHT to determine ptosis severity and its 
      reversibility with an artificial improvement by eyelid taping on an HTC Vive Pro 
      Eye VR headset and the Humphrey visual field analyzer (HVFA) to assess the 
      capabilities of emerging technologies in evaluating ptosis. METHODS: In a single 
      visit, the MCHT was administered along with the HVFA 30-2 on ptotic untaped and 
      taped eyelids in a randomized order. The primary end points were a superior field 
      visibility comparison with severity of VF loss and VF improvement after taping 
      for MCHT and HVFA. Secondary end points included evaluating patients' 
      Likert-scaled survey responses on the comfort, speed, and overall experience with 
      both testing modalities. RESULTS: VR's MCHT superior field degrees visible 
      correlated well for severe category margin to reflex distance (r = 0.78) compared 
      with HVFA's (r = -0.21). The MCHT also demonstrated noninferiority (83.3% 
      agreement; P = 1) against HVFA for detection of 30% or more superior visual field 
      improvement after taping, warranting a corrective surgical intervention. In 
      comparing hemi-VF in untaped eyes, both tests demonstrated relative obstruction 
      to the field when comparing normal controls to severe ptosis (HVFA P < 0.05; MCHT 
      P < 0.001), which proved sufficient to demonstrate percent improvement with 
      taping. The secondary end point of patient satisfaction favored VR vision testing 
      presentation mode in terms of comfort (P < 0.01), speed (P < 0.001), and overall 
      experience (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial supports the use of MCHT for 
      the quantitative measurement of visual field loss owing to ptosis and the 
      reversibility of ptosis that is tested when conducting a presurgical evaluation. 
      We believe the adoption of MCHT testing in oculoplastic clinics could decrease 
      patient burden and accelerate time to corrective treatment. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: In this study, we look at vision field outputs in patients with ptosis 
      to evaluate its severity and improvement with eyelid taping on a low-profile 
      VR-based technology and compare it with HVFA. Our results demonstrate that 
      alternative, portable technologies such as VR can be used to grade the degree of 
      ptosis and determine whether ptosis surgery could provide a significant superior 
      visual field improvement of 30% or more, all while ensuring a more comfortable 
      experience and faster testing time.

TI  - Weekend Admission Increases Risk of Readmissions Following Elective Cervical 
      Spinal Fusion.
PG  - 290-300
LID - 10.14245/ns.2244816.408 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The "weekend effect" occurs when patients cared for during weekends 
      versus weekdays experience worse outcomes. But reasons for this effect are 
      unclear, especially amongst patients undergoing elective cervical spinal fusion 
      (ECSF). Our aim was to analyze whether index weekend admission affects 30- and 
      90-day readmission rates post-ECSF. METHODS: All ECSF patients > 18 years were 
      retrospectively identified from the 2016-2018 Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
      Project Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), using unique patient linkage 
      codes and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Patient 
      demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate logistic 
      regression analyzed primary outcomes of 30- and 90-day readmission rates in 
      weekday or weekend groups. Multivariate regression determined the impact of 
      complications on readmission rates. RESULTS: Compared to the weekday group (n = 
      125,590), the weekend group (n = 1,026) held a higher percentage of 
      Medicare/Medicaid insurance, incurred higher costs, had longer length of stay, 
      and fewer routine home discharge (all p < 0.001). There was no difference in 
      comorbidity burden between weekend versus weekday admissions, as measured by the 
      Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (p = 0.527). Weekend admissions had higher 30-day 
      (4.30% vs. 7.60%, p < 0.001) and 90-day (7.80% vs. 16.10%, p < 0.001) readmission 
      rates, even after adjusting for sex, age, insurance status, and comorbidities. 
      All-cause complication rates were higher for weekend admissions (8.62% vs. 12.7%, 
      p < 0.001), specifically deep vein thrombosis, infection, neurological 
      conditions, and pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: Index weekend admission increases 
      30- and 90-day readmission rates after ECSF. In patients undergoing ECSF on 
      weekends, postoperative care for patients at risk for specific complications will 
      allow for improved outcomes and health care utilization.

TI  - Teledermatology in medical student, postgraduate trainee, and global dermatology 
      education: A systematic review.
PG  - 106-111
LID - 10.1016/j.jdin.2023.01.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical students and 
      residents in the U.S. and globally have gained more exposure to teledermatology, 
      both for the purposes of clinical practice and education. OBJECTIVE: We conducted 
      a systematic review to assess outcomes from teledermatology interventions for 
      dermatology trainees in the U.S. and globally in accordance with Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL for articles written in English and 
      published database inception to November 20, 2022. RESULTS: In total, 15 studies 
      met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes reported ranged broadly from 
      resident-provider concordance rates, diagnostic accuracy in comparison to control 
      groups, number of patients seen, and self-reported satisfaction and improvement. 
      Generally, studies indicated high satisfaction rates and improvement in 
      educational outcomes among medical students, residents, and other trainees in the 
      global health setting. LIMITATIONS: Because of the heterogeneity of study design 
      and outcomes reported, meta-analysis could not be performed. CONCLUSION: 
      Teledermatology can be successfully deployed for clinical care and education 
      domestically and in the global health setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delays in postoperative referrals to rehabilitation or skilled 
      nursing facilities contribute toward extended hospital stays. Facilitating more 
      efficient referrals through accurate preoperative prediction algorithms has the 
      potential to reduce unnecessary economic burden and minimize risk of 
      hospital-acquired complications. We develop a robust machine learning algorithm 
      to predict non-home discharge after thoracolumbar spine surgery that generalizes 
      to unseen populations and identifies markers for prediction. METHODS: 
      Retrospective electronic health records were obtained from our single-center data 
      warehouse (SCDW) to identify patients undergoing thoracolumbar spine surgeries 
      between 2008 and 2019 for algorithm development and internal validation. The 
      National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried to identify thoracolumbar 
      surgeries between 2009 and 2017 for out-of-sample validation. Ensemble decision 
      trees were constructed for prediction and area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess performance. Shapley additive 
      explanations values were derived to identify drivers of non-home discharge for 
      interpretation of algorithm predictions. RESULTS: A total of 5224 cases of 
      thoracolumbar spine surgeries were isolated from the SCDW and 492,312 cases were 
      identified from NIS. The model achieved an AUROC of 0.81 (standard deviation 
      [SD] = 0.01) on the SCDW test set and 0.77 (SD = 0.01) on the nationwide NIS data 
      set, thereby demonstrating robust prediction of non-home discharge across all 
      diverse patient cohorts. Age, total Elixhauser comorbidities, Medicare insurance, 
      weighted Elixhauser score, and female sex were among the most important 
      predictors of non-home discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms 
      reliably predict non-home discharge after thoracolumbar spine surgery across 
      single-center and national cohorts and identify preoperative features of 
      importance that elucidate algorithm decision-making.

LID - 10.1227/neu.0000000000001999 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended postoperative hospital stays are associated with numerous 
      clinical risks and increased economic cost. Accurate preoperative prediction of 
      extended length of stay (LOS) can facilitate targeted interventions to mitigate 
      clinical harm and resource utilization. OBJECTIVE: To develop a machine learning 
      algorithm aimed at predicting extended LOS after cervical spine surgery on a 
      national level and elucidate drivers of prediction. METHODS: Electronic medical 
      records from a large, urban academic medical center were retrospectively examined 
      to identify patients who underwent cervical spine fusion surgeries between 2008 
      and 2019 for machine learning algorithm development and in-sample validation. The 
      National Inpatient Sample database was queried to identify cervical spine fusion 
      surgeries between 2009 and 2017 for out-of-sample validation of algorithm 
      performance. Gradient-boosted trees predicted LOS and efficacy was assessed using 
      the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Shapley 
      values were calculated to characterize preoperative risk factors for extended LOS 
      and explain algorithm predictions. RESULTS: Gradient-boosted trees accurately 
      predicted extended LOS across cohorts, achieving an AUROC of 0.87 (SD = 0.01) on 
      the single-center validation set and an AUROC of 0.84 (SD = 0.00) on the 
      nationwide National Inpatient Sample data set. Anterior approach only, elective 
      admission status, age, and total number of Elixhauser comorbidities were 
      important predictors that affected the likelihood of prolonged LOS. CONCLUSION: 
      Machine learning algorithms accurately predict extended LOS across single-center 
      and national patient cohorts and characterize key preoperative drivers of 
      increased LOS after cervical spine surgery.

TI  - Weekend Admission Increases Risk of Readmissions Following Elective Thoracolumbar 
      Spinal Fusion.
PG  - 667-675

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database study. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study 
      was to assess the influence of weekend admission on patients undergoing elective 
      thoracolumbar spinal fusion by investigating hospital readmission outcomes and 
      analyzing differences in demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative factors. 
      METHODS: The 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmission Database was used to identify adult 
      patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar spinal fusion. The sample was 
      divided into weekday and weekend admission patients. Demographics, comorbidities, 
      complications, and discharge status data were compiled. The primary outcomes were 
      30-day and 90-day readmission. Univariate logistic regression analyzed the 
      relationship between weekday or weekend admission and 30- or 90-day readmission, 
      and multivariate regression determined the impact of covariates. RESULTS: 177,847 
      patients were identified in total, with 176,842 in the weekday cohort and 1005 in 
      the weekend cohort. Multivariate regression analysis found that 30-day 
      readmissions were significantly greater for the weekend cohort after adjusting 
      for sex, age, Medicare or Medicaid status, and comorbidity status (OR 2.00, 95% 
      CI: 1.60-2.48; P < .001), and 90-day readmissions were also greater for the 
      weekend cohort after adjustment (OR 2.01, 95% CI: 1.68-2.40, P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective thoracolumbar spinal fusion surgery who 
      are initially admitted on weekends are more likely to experience hospital 
      readmission. These patients have increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis, 
      postoperative infection, and non-routine discharge status. These factors are 
      potential areas of focus for reducing the impact of the "weekend effect" and 
      improving outcomes for elective thoracolumbar spinal fusion.

TI  - Automated Measurement of Lumbar Lordosis on Radiographs Using Machine Learning 
      and Computer Vision.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1177/2192568219868190 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional database study. OBJECTIVE: To develop a fully 
      automated artificial intelligence and computer vision pipeline for assisted 
      evaluation of lumbar lordosis. METHODS: Lateral lumbar radiographs were used to 
      develop a segmentation neural network (n = 629). After synthetic augmentation, 
      70% of these radiographs were used for network training, while the remaining 30% 
      were used for hyperparameter optimization. A computer vision algorithm was 
      deployed on the segmented radiographs to calculate lumbar lordosis angles. A test 
      set of radiographs was used to evaluate the validity of the entire pipeline (n = 
      151). RESULTS: The U-Net segmentation achieved a test dataset dice score of 
      0.821, an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.914, and an accuracy of 
      0.862. The computer vision algorithm identified the L1 and S1 vertebrae on 84.1% 
      of the test set with an average speed of 0.14 seconds/radiograph. From the 151 
      test set radiographs, 50 were randomly chosen for surgeon measurement. When 
      compared with those measurements, our algorithm achieved a mean absolute error of 
      8.055° and a median absolute error of 6.965° (not statistically significant, P > 
      .05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to use artificial intelligence and 
      computer vision in a combined pipeline to rapidly measure a sagittal spinopelvic 
      parameter without prior manual surgeon input. The pipeline measures angles with 
      no statistically significant differences from manual measurements by surgeons. 
      This pipeline offers clinical utility in an assistive capacity, and future work 
      should focus on improving segmentation network performance.

TI  - Robust prediction of nonhome discharge following elective anterior cervical 
      discectomy and fusion using explainable machine learning.
PG  - 2149-2156
LID - 10.1007/s00586-023-07621-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Predict nonhome discharge (NHD) following elective anterior cervical 
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using an explainable machine learning model. 
      METHODS: 2227 patients undergoing elective ACDF from 2008 to 2019 were identified 
      from a single institutional database. A machine learning model was trained on 
      preoperative variables, including demographics, comorbidity indices, and levels 
      fused. The validation technique was repeated stratified K-Fold cross validation 
      with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) statistic as the 
      performance metric. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were calculated to 
      provide further explainability regarding the model's decision making. RESULTS: 
      The preoperative model performed with an AUROC of 0.83 ± 0.05. SHAP scores 
      revealed the most pertinent risk factors to be age, medicare insurance, and 
      American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Interaction analysis demonstrated 
      that female patients over 65 with greater fusion levels were more likely to 
      undergo NHD. Likewise, ASA demonstrated positive interaction effects with female 
      sex, levels fused and BMI. CONCLUSION: We validated an explainable machine 
      learning model for the prediction of NHD using common preoperative variables. 
      Adding transparency is a key step towards clinical application because it 
      demonstrates that our model's "thinking" aligns with clinical reasoning. 
      Interactive analysis demonstrated that those of age over 65, female sex, higher 
      ASA score, and greater fusion levels were more predisposed to NHD. Age and ASA 
      score were similar in their predictive ability. Machine learning may be used to 
      predict NHD, and can assist surgeons with patient counseling or early discharge 
      planning.

TI  - Development of a machine learning algorithm to identify total and reverse 
      shoulder arthroplasty implants from X-ray images.
PG  - 74-78
LID - 10.1016/j.jor.2022.11.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Demand for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has risen 
      significantly and is projected to continue growing. From 2012 to 2017, the 
      incidence of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) rose from 7.3 cases per 
      100,000 to 19.3 per 100,000. Anatomical TSA saw a growth from 9.5 cases per 
      100,000 to 12.5 per 100,000. Failure to identify implants in a timely manner can 
      increase operative time, cost and risk of complications. Several machine learning 
      models have been developed to perform medical image analysis. However, they have 
      not been widely applied in shoulder surgery. The authors developed a machine 
      learning model to identify shoulder implant manufacturers and type from 
      anterior-posterior X-ray images. METHODS: The model deployed was a convolutional 
      neural network (CNN), which has been widely used in computer vision tasks. 696 
      radiographs were obtained from a single institution. 70% were used to train the 
      model, while evaluation was done on 30%. RESULTS: On the evaluation set, the 
      model performed with an overall accuracy of 93.9% with positive predictive value, 
      sensitivity and F-1 scores of 94% across 10 different implant types (4 reverse, 6 
      anatomical). Average identification time was 0.110 s per implant. CONCLUSION: 
      This proof of concept study demonstrates that machine learning can assist with 
      preoperative planning and improve cost-efficiency in shoulder surgery.

AB  - Effective targeted therapies for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most 
      aggressive form of lung cancer, remain urgently needed. Here we report evidence 
      of preclinical efficacy evoked by targeting the overexpressed cell-cycle 
      checkpoint kinase CHK1 in SCLC. Our studies employed RNAi-mediated attenuation or 
      pharmacologic blockade with the novel second-generation CHK1 inhibitor 
      prexasertib (LY2606368), currently in clinical trials. In SCLC models in vitro 
      and in vivo, LY2606368 exhibited strong single-agent efficacy, augmented the 
      effects of cisplatin or the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and improved the response of 
      platinum-resistant models. Proteomic analysis identified CHK1 and MYC as top 
      predictive biomarkers of LY2606368 sensitivity, suggesting that CHK1 inhibition 
      may be especially effective in SCLC with MYC amplification or MYC protein 
      overexpression. Our findings provide a preclinical proof of concept supporting 
      the initiation of a clinical efficacy trial in patients with platinum-sensitive 
      or platinum-resistant relapsed SCLC. Cancer Res; 77(14); 3870-84. ©2017 AACR.

TI  - Reliable Prediction of Discharge Disposition Following Cervical Spine Surgery 
      With Ensemble Machine Learning and Validation on a National Cohort.
PG  - E30-E36
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0000000000001520 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study 
      is to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict nonhome discharge after 
      cervical spine surgery that is validated and usable on a national scale to ensure 
      generalizability and elucidate candidate drivers for prediction. SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Excessive length of hospital stay can be attributed to delays in 
      postoperative referrals to intermediate care rehabilitation centers or skilled 
      nursing facilities. Accurate preoperative prediction of patients who may require 
      access to these resources can facilitate a more efficient referral and discharge 
      process, thereby reducing hospital and patient costs in addition to minimizing 
      the risk of hospital-acquired complications. METHODS: Electronic medical records 
      were retrospectively reviewed from a single-center data warehouse (SCDW) to 
      identify patients undergoing cervical spine surgeries between 2008 and 2019 for 
      machine learning algorithm development and internal validation. The National 
      Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried to identify cervical spine fusion 
      surgeries between 2009 and 2017 for external validation of algorithm performance. 
      Gradient-boosted trees were constructed to predict nonhome discharge across 
      patient cohorts. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
      (AUROC) was used to measure model performance. SHAP values were used to identify 
      nonlinear risk factors for nonhome discharge and to interpret algorithm 
      predictions. RESULTS: A total of 3523 cases of cervical spine fusion surgeries 
      were included from the SCDW data set, and 311,582 cases were isolated from NIS. 
      The model demonstrated robust prediction of nonhome discharge across all cohorts, 
      achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 
      (SD=0.01) on both the SCDW and nationwide NIS test sets. Anterior approach only, 
      age, elective admission status, Medicare insurance status, and total Elixhauser 
      Comorbidity Index score were the most important predictors of discharge 
      destination. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms reliably predict nonhome 
      discharge across single-center and national cohorts and identify preoperative 
      features of importance following cervical spine fusion surgery.

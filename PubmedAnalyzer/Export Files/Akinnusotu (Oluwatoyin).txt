AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anterior-to-psoas lumbar interbody fusion (ATP-LIF), more commonly 
      referred to as oblique lateral interbody fusion, and lateral transpsoas lumbar 
      interbody fusion (LTP-LIF), also known as extreme lateral interbody fusion, are 
      the two commonly used lateral approaches for performing a lumbar fusion 
      procedure. These approaches help overcome some of the technical challenges 
      associated with traditional approaches for lumbar fusion. In this systematic 
      review and indirect meta-analysis, the authors compared operative and 
      patient-reported outcomes between these two select approaches using available 
      studies. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, the authors conducted an electronic search using 
      the PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies published before May 1, 
      2019. Indirect meta-analysis was conducted on fusion rate, cage movement 
      (subsidence plus migration), permanent deficits, and transient deficits; results 
      were depicted as forest plots of proportions (effect size [ES]). RESULTS: A total 
      of 63 studies were included in this review after applying the exclusion criteria, 
      of which 26 studies investigated the outcomes of ATP-LIF, while 37 studied the 
      outcomes of LTP-LIF. The average fusion rate was found to be similar between the 
      two groups (ES 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.00 vs ES 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97; p = 0.561). 
      The mean incidence of cage movement was significantly higher in the ATP-LIF group 
      compared with the LTP-LIF group (stand-alone: ES 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.27 vs ES 
      0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.16 [p = 0.317]; combined: ES 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.32 vs ES 
      0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.05 [p = 0.002]). The mean incidence of reoperations was 
      significantly higher in patients undergoing ATP-LIF than in those undergoing 
      LTP-LIF (ES 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03 vs ES 0.04, 95% CI 0.02-0.07; p = 0.012). The 
      mean incidence of permanent deficits was similar between the two groups 
      (stand-alone: ES 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06 vs ES 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.12 [p = 0.204]; 
      combined: ES 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06 vs ES 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.08 [p = 0.595]). 
      The postoperative changes in visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability 
      Index (ODI) scores were both found to be higher for ATP-LIF relative to LTP-LIF 
      (VAS: weighted average 4.11 [SD 2.03] vs weighted average 3.75 [SD 1.94] [p = 
      0.004]; ODI: weighted average 28.3 [SD 5.33] vs weighted average 24.3 [SD 4.94] 
      [p < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses indicate that while both approaches are 
      associated with similar fusion rates, ATP-LIF may be related to higher odds of 
      cage movement and reoperations as compared with LTP-LIF. Furthermore, there is no 
      difference in rates of permanent deficits between the two procedures.

TI  - Outcomes following surgical and endovascular treatment of extracranial vertebral 
      artery aneurysms (VAA): a systematic evaluation of the literature.
PG  - 260
LID - 10.1007/s10143-023-02171-5 [doi]
AB  - Extracranial vertebral artery aneurysms are rare complications resulting from 
      trauma and multiple different diseases. However, the difference between clinical 
      and surgical profiles is well understood. To investigate the clinical and 
      interventional outcomes following extracranial vertebral artery aneurysms (VAA) 
      treatment through a systematic review of the literature to date, an electronic 
      database search for full-text English articles was conducted following PRISMA 
      guidelines. The search yielded results on clinical and surgical outcomes for 
      extracranial VAAs. These results included patient-specific risk factors, 
      indications, and techniques. Our literature search resulted in 561 articles, of 
      which 36 studies were qualified to be included in the analysis. A total of 55 
      patients with multiple various extracranial VAA incidents were included. The mean 
      age of subjects was 42 years (ranging from 13.0 to 76.0 years), and the majority 
      of patients were males (71%, n =39). Blunt trauma was the most frequent risk 
      factor for extracranial VAA formation (35%, n = 19). The majority of aneurysms 
      (60%) were dissected in nature. The most common form of treatment for 
      extracranial VAAs was the use of a flow diverter (24%, n=13). Overall, five (9%) 
      patients had long-term adverse neurological complications following intervention 
      with 5% (n=3) mortality, 2% (n=1) resulting in unilateral vocal cord paralysis, 
      and 2% (n=1) resulted in a positive Romberg sign. The mortality rate is 15.7% in 
      the surgical group, whereas the endovascular treatment did not result in any 
      mortality. The endovascular approach is a safe and effective treatment of 
      extracranial VAAs due to its relatively low overall complication rate and lack of 
      resulting mortality. This is in contrast to the surgical approach which results 
      in a higher rate of complications, recurrence, and mortality outcomes. An 
      understanding of the factors and clinical outcomes associated with the incidence 
      of extracranial VAAs is essential for the future improvement of patient outcomes.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Risk Factors for Spastic 
      Cerebral Palsy.
PG  - 435-442
LID - 10.1093/neuros/nyab184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many clinical risk factors of spastic cerebral palsy (CP) 
      have been identified, the genetic basis of spastic CP is largely unknown. Here, 
      using whole-genome genetic information linked to a deidentified electronic health 
      record (BioVU) with replication in the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we perform the 
      first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for spastic CP. OBJECTIVE: To define 
      the genetic basis of spastic CP. METHODS: Whole-genome data were obtained using 
      the multi-ethnic genotyping array (MEGA) genotyping array capturing 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), minor allele frequency (MAF) >Â 0.01, and 
      imputation quality score (r2) >Â 0.3, imputed based on the 1000 genomes phase 3 
      reference panel. Threshold for genome-wide significance was defined after 
      Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested (P 
      <Â 5.0Â ÃÂ 10-8).Â Replication analysis (defined as P <Â .05) was performed in the UK 
      Biobank and FinnGen. RESULTS: We identify 1 SNP (rs78686911) reaching genome-wide 
      significance with spastic CP. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis 
      suggests that rs78686911 decreases expression of GRIK4, a gene that encodes a 
      high-affinity kainate glutamatergic receptor of largely unknown function. 
      Replication analysis in the UK Biobank and FinnGen reveals additional SNPs in the 
      GRIK4 loci associated with CP. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we perform the first 
      GWAS of spastic CP. Our study indicates that genetic variation contributes to CP 
      risk.

TI  - Sport participation and related head injuries following craniosynostosis 
      correction: a survey study.
PG  - E15
LID - 2021.1.FOCUS20970 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Craniosynostosis (CS) affects about 1 in 2500 infants and is 
      predominantly treated by surgical intervention in infancy. Later in childhood, 
      many of these children wish to participate in sports. However, the safety of 
      participation is largely anecdotal and based on surgeon experience. The objective 
      of this survey study was to describe sport participation and sport-related head 
      injury in CS patients. METHODS: A 16-question survey related to child/parent 
      demographics, CS surgery history, sport history, and sport-induced head injury 
      history was made available to patients/parents in the United States through a 
      series of synostosis organization listservs, as well as synostosis-focused 
      Facebook groups, between October 2019 and June 2020. Sports were categorized 
      based on the American Academy of Pediatrics groupings. Pearson's chi-square test, 
      Fisher's exact test, and the independent-samples t-test were used in the 
      analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 187 CS patients were described as 63% male, 89% 
      White, and 88% non-Hispanic, and 89% underwent surgery at 1 year or younger. The 
      majority (74%) had participated in sports starting at an average age of 5 years 
      (SD 2.2). Of those participating in sports, contact/collision sport participation 
      was most common (77%), and 71% participated in multiple sports. Those that played 
      sports were less frequently Hispanic (2.2% vs 22.9%, p < 0.001) and more 
      frequently had undergone a second surgery (44% vs 25%, p = 0.021). Only 9 of 139 
      (6.5%) sport-participating CS patients suffered head injuries; 6 (67%) were 
      concussions and the remaining 3 were nondescript but did not mention any surgical 
      needs. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey of postsurgical CS patients and 
      parents, sport participation was exceedingly common, with contact sports being 
      the most common sport category. Few head injuries (mostly concussions) were 
      reported as related to sport participation. Although this is a selective sample 
      of CS patients, the initial data suggest that sport participation, even in 
      contact sports, and typically beginning a few years after CS correction, is safe 
      and commonplace.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring 
      neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal 
      decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable 
      estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to 
      summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric 
      achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and 
      standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies 
      with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, 
      and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of 
      age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was 
      performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized 
      scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, 
      and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 
      204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 Â± 
      36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n 
      = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic 
      cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 Â± 25 months), 
      with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and 
      delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% 
      of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of 
      treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 
      21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively 
      older children (mean age 13 Â± 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with 
      instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and 
      sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% 
      reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus 
      patients (mean age 56 Â± 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third 
      ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive 
      ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). 
      The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt 
      revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary 
      procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for 
      pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, 
      spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and 
      good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further 
      studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term 
      outcomes.

TI  - Supporting Mental Health and Psychological Resilience Among the Health Care 
      Workforce: Gaps in the Evidence and Urgency for Action.
PG  - S100-S102
LID - 10.1370/afm.2933 [doi]
AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, health care workers have faced various 
      challenges to their mental health due to extreme working conditions. Yet these 
      workers have continued to deliver care in the face of stressors and death among 
      their patients, family, and social networks. The pandemic highlighted weaknesses 
      within our health care work environment, especially pertaining to a need to 
      provide increased psychological resilience to clinicians. There has been little 
      research to determine the best practices for psychological health in workplaces 
      and interventions to improve psychological resilience. Although some studies have 
      attempted to provide solutions, there are noteworthy gaps in the literature on 
      effective interventions to use in the time of crisis. The most common include an 
      absence of preintervention data concerning the overall mental well-being of 
      health care workers, inconsistent application of interventions, and a lack of 
      standard assessment tools across studies. There is an urgent need for 
      system-level strategies that not only transform the way workplaces are organized, 
      but also destigmatize, recognize, support, and treat mental health conditions 
      among health care workers. There is also need for more evidence-based resources 
      to improve resilience on the job, and thereby increase clinicians' capacity to 
      address new medical crises. Doing so may mitigate rates of burnout and other 
      psychological conditions in times of crisis among health care workers.

TI  - Conversion of left atrial volume to diameter for automated estimation of sudden 
      cardiac death risk in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 183-188
LID - 10.1111/echo.14943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is at 
      high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Practice guidelines endorse use of a 
      risk calculator, which requires entry of left atrial (LA) diameter. However, 
      American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines recommend the use of LA 
      volume index (LAVI) for routine quantification of LA size. The aims of this study 
      were to (a) develop a model to estimate LA diameter from LAVI and (b) evaluate 
      whether substitution of measured LA diameter by estimated LA diameter derived 
      from LAVI reclassifies HCM-SCD risk. METHODS: The study cohort was comprised of 
      500 randomly selected HCM patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography 
      (TTE). LA diameter and LAVI were measured offline using digital clips from TTE. 
      Linear regression models were developed to estimate LA diameter from LAVI. A 
      European Society of Cardiology endorsed equation estimated SCD risk, which was 
      measured using LA diameter and estimated LA diameter derived from LAVI. RESULTS: 
      The mean LAVI was 48.5Â Â±Â 18.8Â mL/m(2) . The derived LA diameter was 45.1Â mm (SD: 
      5.5Â mm), similar to the measured LA diameter (45.1Â mm, SD: 7.1Â mm). Median SCD 
      risk at 5Â years estimated by measured LA diameter was 2.22% (interquartile range 
      (IQR): 1.39, 3.56), while median risk calculated by estimated LA diameter was 
      2.18% (IQR: 1.44, 3.52). 476/500 (95%) patients maintained the same risk 
      classification regardless of whether the measured or estimated LA diameter was 
      used. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of measured LA diameter by estimated LA diameter 
      in the HCM-SCD calculator did not reclassify risk.

TI  - Review of the Treatments for Central Neuropathic Pain.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12121727 [doi]
LID - 1727
AB  - Central neuropathic pain (CNP) affects millions worldwide, with an estimated 
      prevalence of around 10% globally. Although there are a wide variety of treatment 
      options available, due to the complex and multidimensional nature in which CNP 
      arises and presents symptomatically, many patients still experience painful 
      symptoms. Pharmaceutical, surgical, non-invasive, cognitive and combination 
      treatment options offer a generalized starting point for alleviating symptoms; 
      however, a more customized approach may provide greater benefit. Here, we comment 
      on the current treatment options that exist for CNP and further suggest the need 
      for additional research regarding the use of biomarkers to help individualize 
      treatment options for patients.

TI  - Botulinum Toxin as an Effective Treatment for Trigeminal Neuralgia in Surgical 
      Practices.
PG  - 314-320
LID - 10.1159/000526053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of craniofacial pain with 
      many medical and surgical therapies, all of which are imperfect. We examine the 
      use of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) as an intermediary approach in surgical 
      practices. METHODS: We retrospectively identified TN patients seen by both pain 
      neurology and neurosurgery at our center. Demographics were collected. Pain 
      intensity was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and compared from 
      baseline to after BTX-A treatment via paired t test. Responder status was 
      assessed, and success of BTX-A was determined for each cohort. Doses of common 
      medications were compared between baseline visit and the most recent BTX-A 
      administration visit. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients underwent BTX-A therapy for 
      TN, 24 (77%) female and 7 (23%) male. Mean age was 62.5 ± 3.1 years and 29 (94%) 
      identified as white. When divided into cohorts according to indication, 11 (35%) 
      failed prior TN surgery, 9 (29%) either declined surgery or were poor surgical 
      candidates, 4 (13%) had multiple sclerosis, 4 (13%) had trigeminal neuropathic 
      pain, and 3 (10%) had atypical TN with pain in additional dermatomes outside the 
      trigeminal distribution. Significant reductions in NRS from baseline to following 
      initial BTX-A treatment were seen in the declined/high risk for surgery (p = 
      0.004) and those who failed prior TN surgery (p = 0.035) groups. No significant 
      variation in demographics was found between any two groups (p > 0.05 for all). 
      Finally, there was no significant reduction in total daily dose of gabapentin, 
      carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, baclofen, or lamotrigine in BTX-A responders (p > 
      0.05 for all). DISCUSSION: Indication is an important predictor for BTX-A, with 
      classical TN patients exhibiting the highest response rates. This research 
      highlights the viability of BTX-A as an important tool in the arsenal of 
      providers seeking to treat TN in a minimally invasive manner.

TI  - Developing a fast-track discharge protocol for patients with cerebral aneurysms 
      treated via neuroendovascular techniques.
PG  - 15910199221104616
LID - 10.1177/15910199221104616 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As we emerge from the current pandemic, hospitals, staff, and 
      resources will need to continue to adjust to meet ongoing healthcare demands. 
      Lessons learned during past shortages can be used to optimize peri-procedural 
      protocols to safely improve the utilization of hospital resources. METHODS: 
      Retrospective review of patients who underwent elective endovascular intracranial 
      aneurysm treatment was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
      identify factors associated with patients who were able to be discharged within 
      24 h of elective procedures. Rates of complications (particularly readmission) 
      were determined. RESULTS: 330 patients underwent elective endovascular aneurysm 
      treatment with 86 (26.1%) discharged within 24 h. Factors associated with earlier 
      discharge included procedure years (2019-2021) and male sex. Patients were more 
      likely to be discharged later (after 24 h) if they underwent stent-coil 
      embolization or flow-diversion. There was no association between discharge timing 
      and likelihood of readmission. DISCUSSION: Our review highlights the safety of 
      earlier discharge and allowed us to prepare a fast-track protocol for same-day 
      discharge in these patients. This protocol will be studied prospectively in the 
      next phase of this study. As we gain more comfort with emerging, minimally 
      invasive endovascular therapies, we hope to safely achieve same-day discharge on 
      a protocolized and routine basis, reducing the demand of elective aneurysm 
      treatments on our healthcare system. CONCLUSION: We retrospectively demonstrate 
      that early discharge following elective aneurysm treatment is safe in our cohort 
      and provide a fast-track pathway based on these findings for other centers 
      developing similar protocols.

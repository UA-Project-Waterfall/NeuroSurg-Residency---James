AB  - The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays an instrumental role in the 
      overall survival and proliferation of cells. As a member of the 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, DNA-PK is best known 
      as a mediator of the cellular response to DNA damage. In this context, DNA-PK has 
      emerged as an intriguing therapeutic target in the treatment of a variety of 
      cancers, especially when used in conjunction with genotoxic chemotherapy or 
      ionizing radiation. Beyond the DNA damage response, DNA-PK activity is necessary 
      for multiple cellular functions, including the regulation of transcription, 
      progression of the cell cycle, and in the maintenance of telomeres. Here, we 
      review what is currently known about DNA-PK regarding its structure and 
      established roles in DNA repair. We also discuss its lesser-known functions, the 
      pharmacotherapies inhibiting its function in DNA repair, and its potential as a 
      therapeutic target in a broader context.

AB  - Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) contribute to the tumorigenicity, progression, and 
      chemoresistance of cancers. It is not known whether CSCs arise from normal stem 
      cells or if they arise from differentiated cancer cells by acquiring self-renewal 
      features. These CSCs share stem cell markers that normal stem cells express. 
      There is a rising interest in octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), one 
      of the stem cell factors that are essential in embryogenesis and pluripotency. 
      OCT4 is also overexpressed in CSCs of various cancers. Although the majority of 
      the studies in CSCs reported a positive association between the expression of 
      OCT4 and chemoresistance and an inverse correlation between OCT4 and clinical 
      prognosis, there are studies rebuking these findings, possibly due to the 
      sparsity of stem cells within tumors and the heterogeneity of tumors. In 
      addition, post-translational modification of OCT4 affects its activity and 
      warrants further investigation for its association with chemoresistance and 
      prognosis.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor noted for the rapid 
      development of both metastases and resistance to chemotherapy. High mutation 
      burden, ubiquitous loss of TP53 and RB1, and a mutually exclusive amplification 
      of MYC gene family members contribute to genomic instability and make the 
      development of new targeted agents a challenge. Previously, we reported a novel 
      OCT4-induced MYC transcriptional activation pathway involving c-MYC, pOCT4(S111), 
      and MAPKAPK2 in progressive neuroblastoma, also a neuroendocrine tumor. Using 
      tumor microarray analysis of clinical samples and preclinical models, we now 
      report a correlation in expression between these proteins in SCLC. In correlating 
      c-MYC protein expression with genomic amplification, we determined that some SCLC 
      cell lines exhibited high c-MYC without genomic amplification, implying 
      amplification-independent MYC activation. We then confirmed direct interaction 
      between OCT4 and DNA-PKcs and identified specific OCT4 and DNA-PKcs binding 
      sites. Knock-down of both POU5F1 (encoding OCT4) and PRKDC (encoding DNA-PKcs) 
      resulted in decreased c-MYC expression. Further, we confirmed binding of OCT4 to 
      the promoter/enhancer region of MYC. Together, these data establish the presence 
      of a DNA-PKcs/OCT4/c-MYC pathway in SCLCs. We then disruptively targeted this 
      pathway and demonstrated anticancer activity in SCLC cell lines and xenografts 
      using both DNA-PKcs inhibitors and a protein-protein interaction inhibitor of 
      DNA-PKcs and OCT4. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that DNA-PKcs can mediate 
      high c-MYC expression in SCLCs, and that this pathway may represent a new 
      therapeutic target for SCLCs with high c-MYC expression.

AB  - Amplification-independent c-MYC overexpression is suggested in multiple cancers. 
      Targeting c-MYC activity has therapeutic potential, but efforts thus far have 
      been mostly unsuccessful. To find a druggable target to modulate c-MYC activity 
      in cancer, we identified two kinases, MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and the DNA-dependent 
      protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which phosphorylate the Ser111 and 
      the Ser93 residues of OCT4, respectively, to transcriptionally activate c-MYC. 
      Using these observations, we present here a novel cell-based luminescence assay 
      to identify compounds that inhibit the interaction between these kinases and 
      OCT4. After screening approximately 80,000 compounds, we identified 56 compounds 
      ("hits") that inhibited the luminescence reaction between DNA-PKcs and OCT4, and 
      65 hits inhibiting the MK2-OCT4 interaction. Using custom antibodies specific for 
      pOCT4(S93) and pOCT4(S111) , the "hits" were validated for their effect on OCT4 
      phosphorylation and activation. Using a two-step method for validation, we 
      identified two candidate compounds from the DNA-PKcs assay and three from the MK2 
      assay. All five compounds demonstrate a significant ability to kill cancer cells 
      in the nanomolar range. In conclusion, we developed a cell-based luminescence 
      assay to identify novel inhibitors targeting c-MYC transcriptional activation, 
      and have found five compounds that may function as lead compounds for further 
      development.

TI  - Analysis of Frontal Sinus Fracture Management and Resource Utilization.
PG  - 2240-2242
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000006706 [doi]
AB  - Frontal sinus fractures require a large amount of force and often occur in the 
      context of a major trauma. Many patients with these fractures are assessed in an 
      emergent setting where stabilization takes precedence. Delayed diagnosis and 
      treatment of a sinus fracture can result in life-threatening conditions, such as 
      a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. A number of different treatment algorithms have 
      been proposed, highlighting the complexity of frontal sinus fracture management. 
      The goal of this study is to determine how patients with frontal sinus fractures 
      were treated at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and what 
      complications arose as a result of the fracture and subsequent management 
      strategy. Over 9 years, there were 69 reported cases. A total of 63 of these 
      occurred in males (91.3%) versus 6 (8.7%) in females. The majority occurred after 
      a motor vehicle collision (MVC) or a motorcycle collision (MCC). A total of 51 
      cases were unilateral fractures and 18 were bilateral fractures. Five patients 
      (7.2%) had CSF leakage and 64 (92.8%) did not have CSF leakage. One patient with 
      CSF leakage (20.0%) was managed operatively. Of the 64 patients without CSF 
      leakage, 4 (6.3%) were managed operatively. All operative patients were managed 
      by cranialization. Complications included vision changes, facial pressure, 
      anosmia, facial paresthesia, pneumocephalus, and mucus retention cysts. Vision 
      changes were the most common complication. There did not appear to be any 
      significant difference in complications between the CSF leakage groups, 
      indicating that non-operative management remains a viable option in the 
      management of frontal sinus fractures.
